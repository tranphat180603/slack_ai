Chain Configuration (chain_config.py)\n\n- [X] Create ChainConfig class with RPC prefix, chain ID, name, and currency\n- [X] Implement chain configuration dictionary for supported networks:\n  - Mainnet: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, zkSync, Avalanche, Fantom\n  - Testnet: Sepolia, Goerli, Mumbai, Arbitrum Goerli, Optimism Goerli, Base Goerli\n- [X] Add helper functions for RPC URL construction\n- [X] Implement chain validation and error handling\n\n### 2\\. Token Transfer Analysis (transaction_analyzer.py)\n\n- [X] Implement Web3 connection setup with Alchemy\n- [X] Add ERC20 transfer event detection and parsing\n- [X] Extract transfer information:\n  - From/To addresses\n  - Token amount with proper decimal handling\n  - Raw transfer value\n- [X] Categorize transfers (incoming/outgoing)\n- [X] Add error handling for failed contract calls\n\n### 3\\. Token Information Retrieval\n\n- [X] Implement ERC20 contract interaction\n- [X] Fetch token metadata:\n  - Token name\n  - Token symbol\n  - Decimals\n- [X] Handle unknown tokens gracefully\n- [X] Add proper error handling for contract calls\n\n### 4\\. Price Tracking Integration\n\n- [X] Implement Coingecko API integration\n- [X] Add chain-to-platform ID mapping\n- [X] Fetch current token prices in USD\n- [X] Calculate total transfer value in USD\n- [X] Handle missing price data gracefully\n\n### 5\\. Output Formatting\n\n- [X] Structure transfer information display\n- [X] Format token information section:\n  * Name, Symbol, Decimals\n  * Contract address\n  * Current price in USD\n- [X] Format transfer details section:\n  * From/To addresses\n  * Amount with symbol\n  * USD value\n  * Raw amount\n\n## Pending Enhancements\n\n- [ ] Add historical price data at time of transaction\n- [ ] Add gas cost analysis\n- [ ] Implement caching for token metadata and prices\n- [ ] Add support for custom RPC endpoints\n- [ ] Create CLI interface for better usability\n- [ ] Add transaction summary statistics\n- [ ] Add unit tests and documentation\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* web3==6.15.1\n* python-dotenv==1.0.1\n* requests==2.31.0\n\n## Environment Requirements\n\n* Python 3.7+\n* Alchemy API key\n* Internet connection for Web3 and Coingecko API\n\n## Usage Example\n\n```python\nchain = 'optimism'\naddress = '0x45D4778a5ad57fa9d102aD47005757fE7640fb45'\ntx_hash = '0xf9c134919d52c474e98aff653a0bb120392210f6c0e976d7e23b5c0f016faddd'\nresults = analyze_transfer_events(chain, address, tx_hash)\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n* Coingecko API is rate-limited for free tier\n* Some tokens might not have price data available\n* USD values shown are based on current prices, not historical\n* Token contract calls might fail for non-standard implementations",

This means that it uses existing unmodified [execution clients](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/help/glossary#execution-client) like Geth, Reth, Erigon, Nethermind, and more to handle executing smart contracts and supports all the tooling that comes native with the EVM.\n* Identical means that whenever the EVM is upgraded, Berachain can adopt the latest version\u2014for example, Dencun\u2014straight out of the box. This includes compatibility with all RPC namespaces and endpoints, and any improvements made to execution clients can be applied immediately to Berachain.\n* Proof-of-Liquidity\u00a0\n  * Proof-of-Liquidity radically changes the way L1 economics are structured, prioritizing users and applications over validator rewards at baseline. Network incentives go towards enriching ecosystem liquidity, contributing to efficient trading, price stability, securing the chain, and increasing network/user growth.\n  * Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) is a novel economic mechanism that uses network incentives to align the interests of ecosystem participants and bolster both application-layer and chain security.\n  * Berachain's consensus borrows from the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model and contains two key components:\n    * [$BERA](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/tokens/bera) - Validators secure the chain by staking the native gas token\n    * [$BGT](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/tokens/bgt) - A soulbound governance token distributed by validators for proposing new blocks, which is ultimately rewarded to users who provide ecosystem liquidity (see [Reward Vaults](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/rewardvaults))\n  * A validator's $BGT emissions increase with the amount of $BGT delegated to them. Protocol-provided [Incentives](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/incentives) are received for these emissions, and validators pass these to their delegators after collecting a commission.\n  * \u00a0Proof-of-Liquidity separates the token responsible for gas and security from the token used to govern chain rewards and economic incentives.\n  * \n* BeaconKit is a modular framework developed by Berachain for building EVM [consensus clients](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/help/glossary#consensus-client).

Boosts are obtained when $BGT holders delegate to validators.\n  * For each block proposed, the validator receives both a base emission and a variable reward emission based on their boost percentage\n  * After collecting the base $BGT rewards for themselves, validators direct the remaining variable $BGT rewards to whitelisted [Reward Vaults](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/rewardvaults) of their choosing (\u2463). In exchange for directing their emissions, validators receive protocol-provided [Incentives](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/incentives) from Reward Vaults (the $BGT is earned by users supplying liquidity to the protocol).\n  * Protocols creating Reward Vaults must additionally [whitelist their vaults](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/governance/rewardvault) through $BGT governance to be eligible to receive emissions from validators.\n* Reward Vaults\n  * Reward Vaults are smart contracts in which users can stake their Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) eligible assets to receive $BGT rewards. Reward Vaults are the only way anyone can earn $BGT rewards, and therefore serve the important function of gating entry into the PoL ecosystem.\n* Ecosystem Alignment \ud83e\udd1d\n  * By integrating Berachain's native network rewards among all ecosystem participants, PoL creates alignment between:\n\n\n* Validators: Need $BGT delegation to maximize their block rewards and must efficiently direct emissions to reward vaults to earn Incentives and attract more boost.\n* Protocols: Compete for $BGT emissions by offering attractive Incentive rates in their reward vaults\n* Users: Earn $BGT by providing liquidity, then delegate to validators who maximize returns\n\n\n* Berachain Tokenomics\n  * $BERA serves as the native gas and staking token of Berachain, the first blockchain powered by Proof-of-Liquidity, while $BGT facilitates governance and economic incentives.\n  * Users who are boosting validators with their $BGT earn a share of Berachain core dApp fees, namely fees from BEX and HoneySwap. This is done via the [FeeCollector](https://docs.berachain.com/developers/contracts/fee-collector) contract.\n  * $HONEY is Berachain's native stablecoin, designed to provide a stable and reliable means of exchange within the Berachain ecosystem and beyond. $HONEY is fully collateralized and soft-pegged to the US Dollar.\n* Native dapps\n  * BeraHub is the place to manage all things $BGT and access Berachain liquidity through BEX.\n  * Berachain's native decentralized exchange (DEX), BEX, allows trading of any arbitrary pair of crypto assets via swapping and providing liquidity into [liquidity pools](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/help/glossary#liquidity-pool).\n  * Honey Swap allows users to trade approved stables and assets for [$HONEY](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/tokens/honey).\n  * [BeraScan Block Explorer](https://berascan.com/)\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdwtSVM02JDIIKyrbRaz1xK9vYMEwKCgucXBduYI6vZuQZrhW3Acm4w3Ot4f7Q4Y_RyBcoooQevBEqu1WxOzRAtFiv6syrc1DElqdVI9JWDwgqyfGrzS9nX_AkM89CfsRIhpCqPqQ?key=0wJFrmhJn5x8MfCVVceZMoMm)\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcE1fHwWxuL4JgG9uGHoMauVth_JbAZA2PpWfJT0dNN2ir2D_L9J-Q9Yku5eQCPqBPIsuxh7K2hGXe2alH3BvZ6-zxCYHlkDmqCm0Xjc4_O-oQYf7ZCnICcGmUq2HwatbQ2AVLjig?key=0wJFrmhJn5x8MfCVVceZMoMm)",

In exchange for directing their emissions, validators receive protocol-provided [Incentives](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/incentives) from Reward Vaults (the $BGT is earned by users supplying liquidity to the protocol).\n  * Protocols creating Reward Vaults must additionally [whitelist their vaults](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/governance/rewardvault) through $BGT governance to be eligible to receive emissions from validators.\n* Reward Vaults\n  * Reward Vaults are smart contracts in which users can stake their Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) eligible assets to receive $BGT rewards. Reward Vaults are the only way anyone can earn $BGT rewards, and therefore serve the important function of gating entry into the PoL ecosystem.\n* Ecosystem Alignment \ud83e\udd1d\n  * By integrating Berachain's native network rewards among all ecosystem participants, PoL creates alignment between:\n\n\n* Validators: Need $BGT delegation to maximize their block rewards and must efficiently direct emissions to reward vaults to earn Incentives and attract more boost.\n* Protocols: Compete for $BGT emissions by offering attractive Incentive rates in their reward vaults\n* Users: Earn $BGT by providing liquidity, then delegate to validators who maximize returns\n\n\n* Berachain Tokenomics\n  * $BERA serves as the native gas and staking token of Berachain, the first blockchain powered by Proof-of-Liquidity, while $BGT facilitates governance and economic incentives.\n  * Users who are boosting validators with their $BGT earn a share of Berachain core dApp fees, namely fees from BEX and HoneySwap. This is done via the [FeeCollector](https://docs.berachain.com/developers/contracts/fee-collector) contract.\n  * $HONEY is Berachain's native stablecoin, designed to provide a stable and reliable means of exchange within the Berachain ecosystem and beyond. $HONEY is fully collateralized and soft-pegged to the US Dollar.\n* Native dapps\n  * BeraHub is the place to manage all things $BGT and access Berachain liquidity through BEX.\n  * Berachain's native decentralized exchange (DEX), BEX, allows trading of any arbitrary pair of crypto assets via swapping and providing liquidity into [liquidity pools](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/help/glossary#liquidity-pool).\n  * Honey Swap allows users to trade approved stables and assets for [$HONEY](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/tokens/honey).\n  * [BeraScan Block Explorer](https://berascan.com/)\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdwtSVM02JDIIKyrbRaz1xK9vYMEwKCgucXBduYI6vZuQZrhW3Acm4w3Ot4f7Q4Y_RyBcoooQevBEqu1WxOzRAtFiv6syrc1DElqdVI9JWDwgqyfGrzS9nX_AkM89CfsRIhpCqPqQ?key=0wJFrmhJn5x8MfCVVceZMoMm)\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcE1fHwWxuL4JgG9uGHoMauVth_JbAZA2PpWfJT0dNN2ir2D_L9J-Q9Yku5eQCPqBPIsuxh7K2hGXe2alH3BvZ6-zxCYHlkDmqCm0Xjc4_O-oQYf7ZCnICcGmUq2HwatbQ2AVLjig?key=0wJFrmhJn5x8MfCVVceZMoMm)"

These can be constructed using on-chain or any peer-to-peer social graph data. OpenRank enables graph algorithms like EigenTrust, Hubs and Authorities, Collaborative Filtering to compute reputation and ranking using these reputation graphs.\n\nThe Ranking and Reputation stack:\n\n* **Data Layer:** This enables any developer or application to bring their own data sets for compute.\n* **OpenRank Protocol:** A decentralized compute network to ensure verifiable, scalable and permissionless ranking and reputation compute.\n* **Apps and Clients using Rankings:** Developers, Protocols and Data scientists can utilize the verifiable rankings data to build desirable reputation, filtration, airdrop, search and discovery, feeds or gating strategies and applications.\n\n## Use Case / Features:\n\n* Using OpenRank, developers can create ranking, recommendation and sybil-resistance systems for their applications and protocols. Developers can also power search and discovery for marketplaces and consumer applications.\n* Using OpenRank, consumer applications and marketplaces can integrate context-specific, native rankings and recommendations seamlessly.\n* Any user or developer using OpenRank is assured of verifiability of the rankings and reputation computation. This enables a critical trust layer for users who are interacting with various applications to search and discover things onchain, or even for protocols to reward contributors based on verifiable ranking and reputation data.\n* In the longer run, anyone could publish their algorithms to OpenRank and get rewarded if their algorithms are utilized by application developers. A shared reputation infrastructure for accessing compute and existing rankings creates a flywheel for developer network effects.\n\nUse Cases:\n\n* **Social Networks**\n  * **Provide ranking and recommendation systems, enabling personalized and curated community experiences instead of a single global feed or ranking.**\n  * **Enables clients and developers to choose their algorithms and give users freedom to explore content and feeds of their choice.**\n  * **Helps detect and reduce spam and sybil clusters faster and cheaper through community curation of rankings.**\n  * **Implementation with Lens and Farcaster**\n\n* **Marketplaces**\n  * **Enables transparency in how ratings, rankings, and recommendations are done on a marketplace and bring personalized search and discovery for users.**\n  * **Helps bring down the cost and efficiency of trust and safety through community wisdom versus centralized teams that end up costing significantly higher.**\n  * **Opens up the innovation surface for ranking systems for trust and fraud heuristics to the community instead of relying on a centralized authority's opinion.**\n\n* **Consumer Apps and Wallets**\n  * **Enables personalized and contextually relevant feeds or recommendations of most popular apps/tokens/NFTs in a users own onchain graph.**\n  * **Drives composability of reputation graphs across different applications.**\n  * **Brings social discovery as the key construct for users instead of a general or popular thing to do onchain.**\n\n* **Governance and Public Goods Funding**\n  * **Enables collectives to leverage reputation to better drive governance and funding decisions, capturing peer-to-peer trust signals.**\n  * **Makes possible the discovery of project impact based on onchain engagement data that is anchored by trusted members of the community.**\n  * **Facilitates building various reputation graphs that signal domain expertise of community members in various contexts, resulting in reputation-based vote weighting**\n\n## Traction:\n\nLive integrations powered by OpenRank:\n\nFor each of the applications and use cases below, we have generated context-specific reputation graphs and computed various reputation and ranking algorithms like EigenTrust, Collaborative Filtering, Hubs and Authorities.\n\n* **Farcaster** - Ranking APIs to build better profile, frames, cast rankings and recommendations based on Farcaster social graph.\n* **Lens** - Ranking APIs\u00a0 to build better profile rankings and content feeds based on Lens social graph.\n* **Metamask Snaps Permissionless Distribution** - Prototype of a reputation computer based on positive/negative attestations to detect a community sentiment around the safety of a Snap. This can enable permissionless distibuion of Snaps within Metamask.\n* **Onchain Graphs and Feeds** - Personalized Ranking APIs to find your onchain graph - your extended onchain network of friends/users based on p2p token transfers, NFT ownership and contract interaction.\n\n## Tokenomics:\n\n* \n\n## Roadmap:\n\nAfter launching reputation systems with design partners, we plan to launch an open, permissionless and verifiable protocol.\n\nUpcoming Integrations:\n\n* **Reputation-based airdrops**\n  * Using existing onchain and social graph data, communities and protocols utilize OpenRank to surface highly ranked or reputable contributors or participants. These rankings are based on reputation graphs, making it effective and transparent for airdrop allocations.\n* **Discover valuable users and apps**\n  * Onchain transaction graphs originating from reputable users are used as inputs for OpenRank to compute highly ranked or valuable users and apps on a particular chain.\n* **Retroactive Public Goods Funding**\n  * To allocate public goods funding according to the impact generated by applicant projects, Openrank compute can be used to rank most valuable apps (see above use-case). In addition, reputation graphs based on domain-reputation-weighted expert votes can also be computed to generate project rankings (see MetaMask SPD use-case).\n* **Spam Filtering and Personalized Recommendations**\n  * Permissionless messaging protocols can use OpenRank to filter out spam and recommend reputable users, based on a variety of reputation graphs.\n* **Dapp Stores and Explorers**\n  * Personalized recommendation of apps on decentralized apps store and block explorers. Social and onchain transaction-based graphs are used to sort apps based on a user\u2019s network.\n* **Personalized and Channel specific Feeds**\n  * Powering community and channel specific rankings and feeds. In addition, personalized 'For You' feeds based on direct engagement reputation graphs.\n* **Rating system for crowdfunding protocols**\n  * Crowdfunding protocols can use a community-driven ranking system for filtering, sorting, and rating crowdfunding projects to safeguard users and creators navigating the platform.\n* **Contribution ranking in OSS communities**\n  * Open Source Software contribution graphs and dependency graphs benefit from open verifiable reputation ranking to surface contributions for the OSS community. Graph-based algorithms are used to capture peer-to-peer signals in this context.\n\n## Business Model:\n\n* \n\n## Go-To-Market:\n\n* \n\n## Investors:\n\n* \n\n## Community:\n\n* 540 on X\n* 3.3k on Farcaster\n\n## Competition:\u00a0\n\n* \n\n## Team:\u00a0\n\n* ",

These can be constructed using on-chain or any peer-to-peer social graph data. OpenRank enables graph algorithms like EigenTrust, Hubs and Authorities, Collaborative Filtering to compute reputation and ranking using these reputation graphs.\n\nThe Ranking and Reputation stack:\n\n* **Data Layer:** This enables any developer or application to bring their own data sets for compute.\n* **OpenRank Protocol:** A decentralized compute network to ensure verifiable, scalable and permissionless ranking and reputation compute.\n* **Apps and Clients using Rankings:** Developers, Protocols and Data scientists can utilize the verifiable rankings data to build desirable reputation, filtration, airdrop, search and discovery, feeds or gating strategies and applications.\n\n## Use Case / Features:\n\n* Using OpenRank, developers can create ranking, recommendation and sybil-resistance systems for their applications and protocols. Developers can also power search and discovery for marketplaces and consumer applications.\n* Using OpenRank, consumer applications and marketplaces can integrate context-specific, native rankings and recommendations seamlessly.\n* Any user or developer using OpenRank is assured of verifiability of the rankings and reputation computation. This enables a critical trust layer for users who are interacting with various applications to search and discover things onchain, or even for protocols to reward contributors based on verifiable ranking and reputation data.\n* In the longer run, anyone could publish their algorithms to OpenRank and get rewarded if their algorithms are utilized by application developers. A shared reputation infrastructure for accessing compute and existing rankings creates a flywheel for developer network effects.\n\nUse Cases:\n\n* **Social Networks**\n  * **Provide ranking and recommendation systems, enabling personalized and curated community experiences instead of a single global feed or ranking.**\n  * **Enables clients and developers to choose their algorithms and give users freedom to explore content and feeds of their choice.**\n  * **Helps detect and reduce spam and sybil clusters faster and cheaper through community curation of rankings.**\n  * **Implementation with Lens and Farcaster**\n\n* **Marketplaces**\n  * **Enables transparency in how ratings, rankings, and recommendations are done on a marketplace and bring personalized search and discovery for users.**\n  * **Helps bring down the cost and efficiency of trust and safety through community wisdom versus centralized teams that end up costing significantly higher.**\n  * **Opens up the innovation surface for ranking systems for trust and fraud heuristics to the community instead of relying on a centralized authority's opinion.**\n\n* **Consumer Apps and Wallets**\n  * **Enables personalized and contextually relevant feeds or recommendations of most popular apps/tokens/NFTs in a users own onchain graph.**\n  * **Drives composability of reputation graphs across different applications.**\n  * **Brings social discovery as the key construct for users instead of a general or popular thing to do onchain.**\n\n* **Governance and Public Goods Funding**\n  * **Enables collectives to leverage reputation to better drive governance and funding decisions, capturing peer-to-peer trust signals.**\n  * **Makes possible the discovery of project impact based on onchain engagement data that is anchored by trusted members of the community.**\n  * **Facilitates building various reputation graphs that signal domain expertise of community members in various contexts, resulting in reputation-based vote weighting**\n\n## Traction:\n\nLive integrations powered by OpenRank:\n\nFor each of the applications and use cases below, we have generated context-specific reputation graphs and computed various reputation and ranking algorithms like EigenTrust, Collaborative Filtering, Hubs and Authorities.\n\n* **Farcaster** - Ranking APIs to build better profile, frames, cast rankings and recommendations based on Farcaster social graph.\n* **Lens** - Ranking APIs\u00a0 to build better profile rankings and content feeds based on Lens social graph.\n* **Metamask Snaps Permissionless Distribution** - Prototype of a reputation computer based on positive/negative attestations to detect a community sentiment around the safety of a Snap. This can enable permissionless distibuion of Snaps within Metamask.\n* **Onchain Graphs and Feeds** - Personalized Ranking APIs to find your onchain graph - your extended onchain network of friends/users based on p2p token transfers, NFT ownership and contract interaction.\n\n## Tokenomics:\n\n* \n\n## Roadmap:\n\nAfter launching reputation systems with design partners, we plan to launch an open, permissionless and verifiable protocol.\n\nUpcoming Integrations:\n\n* **Reputation-based airdrops**\n  * Using existing onchain and social graph data, communities and protocols utilize OpenRank to surface highly ranked or reputable contributors or participants. These rankings are based on reputation graphs, making it effective and transparent for airdrop allocations.\n* **Discover valuable users and apps**\n  * Onchain transaction graphs originating from reputable users are used as inputs for OpenRank to compute highly ranked or valuable users and apps on a particular chain.\n* **Retroactive Public Goods Funding**\n  * To allocate public goods funding according to the impact generated by applicant projects, Openrank compute can be used to rank most valuable apps (see above use-case). In addition, reputation graphs based on domain-reputation-weighted expert votes can also be computed to generate project rankings (see MetaMask SPD use-case).\n* **Spam Filtering and Personalized Recommendations**\n  * Permissionless messaging protocols can use OpenRank to filter out spam and recommend reputable users, based on a variety of reputation graphs.\n* **Dapp Stores and Explorers**\n  * Personalized recommendation of apps on decentralized apps store and block explorers. Social and onchain transaction-based graphs are used to sort apps based on a user\u2019s network.\n* **Personalized and Channel specific Feeds**\n  * Powering community and channel specific rankings and feeds. In addition, personalized 'For You' feeds based on direct engagement reputation graphs.\n* **Rating system for crowdfunding protocols**\n  * Crowdfunding protocols can use a community-driven ranking system for filtering, sorting, and rating crowdfunding projects to safeguard users and creators navigating the platform.\n* **Contribution ranking in OSS communities**\n  * Open Source Software contribution graphs and dependency graphs benefit from open verifiable reputation ranking to surface contributions for the OSS community. Graph-based algorithms are used to capture peer-to-peer signals in this context.\n\n## Business Model:\n\n* \n\n## Go-To-Market:\n\n* \n\n## Investors:\n\n* \n\n## Community:\n\n* 540 on X\n* 3.3k on Farcaster\n\n## Competition:\u00a0\n\n* \n\n## Team:\u00a0\n\n* "

We are driven by the belief that data ownership should rest with individual producers, not large corporations or organizations. By generating vast volumes of ultra-high-definition 3D and 4D data\u2014complete with detailed timelines\u2014ROVR is establishing a robust foundation for the next generation of 3D AI training.\n* ROVR is a highly transparent and autonomous project, where any organization or individual can produce, sell, or even DIY their hardware devices within the open-source framework of the ROVR project. They can also participate in data collection, storage, maintenance, and processing, and can join or leave the ROVR network at any time.\n* The ROVR community plays a crucial role throughout the entire ROVR network. It consists of members from various roles such as data contributors, data consumers, developers, DIY enthusiasts, hardware manufacturers, and computing platform providers. Together, they ensure the healthy operation of the ROVR network.\n\n## Innovation:\n\n* The ROVR ecosystem operates through a multi-layered structure, with its foundation rooted in the DePIN layer. Data contributors leverage ROVR hardware to collect 3D data from open environments. This raw data is processed by professional data processing companies into highly commercialized data products. These refined datasets are then utilized by data consumers in fields such as intelligent driving and spatial AI training. Building on the DePIN layer, a 1:1 mirrored metaverse will be developed, where real-world data assets are fully tokenized, enabling seamless value exchange and interoperability.\n\n* ROVR will fully adopt onboard RTK (Real-time Kinematic) and PPK (Post-processed Kinematic) systems, supplemented by AGNSS and integrated navigation, to consistently improve the overall system positioning accuracy to the centimeter level.\n* ROVR will employ automotive-grade mass-produced multi-channel solid-state 3-dimensional LiDAR and onboard survey-grade IMU systems. In the collected raw data, approximately 1 million laser reflection points with an accuracy within 2 cm are generated per second to describe the surrounding scene and for 3D reconstruction.\n\n## Use Case / Features:\n\n* Drive, Explore, and Earn Tokens on the Go\n* **\"TarantulaX Mini\"** is a highly integrated and compact sensor system, including an enhanced RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) positioning unit, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and a Web3 identity and data validation module. It connects to smartphones via Bluetooth. It utilizes the smartphone's camera to capture road images, process and classify the data, and upload it, thereby earning $ROVR tokens.\n* The **\u201cLightCone\u201d** is a professional device equipped with a multi-channel lidar (>120 channels, 200 meters measurement range), capable of directly sensing the surrounding 3-dimensional environment in real-time. It also integrates automotive-grade integrated navigation systems and large-aperture (>130mm) measurement antennas. The device integrates 4G/5G networks to automatically collect, process, and upload data, earning $ROVR tokens, as well.\n* It's worth noting that whether it's the \u201cTarantula Mini\u201d or the \u201cLightCone\u201d, the user device's speed must be between 15 km/h and 140 km/h. Rewards will not be generated if the speed exceeds or falls below this range. The reward is related to the number of kilometers of quality data.\n* **R-Node** serves as the data storage and processing node for the ROVR network. Users can provide nodes that meet the requirements of hardware, software, and network conditions, and stake $ROVR tokens to earn $ROVR token rewards, including basic rewards and additional workload rewards.\n\n## Traction:\n\n## Tokenomics:\n\n* $ROVR is the token of ROVR Network in the future. Contributors can earn $ROVR rewards by using ROVR devices (TarantulaX, LightCone) to collect data, or provide data storage nodes, or by staking on storage nodes.\n* Anyone contributing to the ROVR network, whether through data collection or other means, will receive very fair token rewards. These tokens are distributed based on actual workload and cost input. In other words, it's a return to proof-of-work (POW), but with a more meaningful and environmentally friendly approach, capable of generating significant social and economic value.\n* ROVR Reward Points are designed for contributors to the ROVR project. Before the official token issuance ($ROVR), data collection contributors will be recorded and receive points as rewards. During the TGE (Token Generation Event), these reward points will be converted into $ROVR tokens at a certain ratio (ideally 1:1 or a similar rate, depending on user growth and external/internal factors at the time of TGE) and distributed as airdrops.\n* For future data consumers purchasing ROVR data services, the ROVR Foundation will use the received fiat currency or stablecoins to buy back $ROVR on the secondary market, and then burn 100% of it.\n\n## Roadmap:\n\n* \n\n## Business Model:\n\n* ROVR Inc. is responsible for cleansing, processing, and ultimately transforming the data within the ROVR network into HD maps and other data products, which are then sold to end customers.\n* ROVR Inc. can provide customized maps or other data services according to the requirements of OEM/Tier 1 or other clients.\n* When the time is right, similar to hardware development and production, ROVR will open up third-party data processing. Any organization or individual will be able to perform secondary processing on ROVR data and sell it to end users.

This significantly reduces RAM requirements and reduces the cost of running a node\u2014 creating a clear path to scalable decentralization.\n* Monad is a redesign of both the consensus and execution systems of Ethereum that preserves compatibility for EVM smart contracts and Ethereum\u2019s RPC API.\n* Optimistic Parallel Execution\n  * Monad employs optimistic parallel execution, executing transactions in parallel before previous ones are completed\u2060. Results are committed in the original order and checked against the current state to ensure accuracy.\n  * Efficiently processes blockchain transactions by executing them in parallel using multiple virtual machines, predicting dependencies to optimize scheduling, and merging results sequentially to ensure correct execution order while maximizing resource utilization.\n* A custom database for storing blockchain state, using Patricia Trie data structure, both on-disk and in-memory\u2014 reducing hardware requirements.\n* Asynchronous Execution\n  * Execution is decoupled from consensus, allowing single-shard blockchain to scale to millions of users. Execution begins on a block after consensus completes, running in parallel to the next block\u2019s consensus.\n  * In Monad, nodes come to consensus (i.e. agreement about the official ordering of transactions), without ever executing those transactions.\n  * \n* MonadBFT\n  * A custom BFT mechanism derived from HotStuff, optimized to reduce communication phases from three to two, enhancing efficiency. Its optimistically responsive design allows rounds to progress at actual network latency, improving performance.\n  * MonadBFT operates under the assumptions of partial synchrony and a maximum 33% Byzantine stake weight.\n  * A high-performance POS consensus mechanism with 1s block times on MonadDB.\n  * \n* MonadDB\n  * MonadDb is a critical component in Monad for maintaining full Ethereum compatibility while delivering high performance. It is a custom-built key-value database designed for storing authenticated blockchain data.\n  * A custom state database that significantly enhances blockchain performance by optimizing storage and access of Merkle Patricia Trie data, enabling high-performance parallel access crucial for Monad's parallel execution capabilities.\n  * MonadDB allows you to keep most of the state on SSD instead of RAM\u2014 reducing RAM requirements, costs and allowing consumer-grade hardware to participate in the network.\n* the Monad Foundation, an independent organization dedicated to encouraging the development and adoption of the Monad blockchain protocol.\u00a0\n  * The Foundation\u2019s principal activity will be to facilitate validator-led governance and community-led improvement proposals; provide developer documentation relating to the network; and engage in ecosystem development, marketing, and advisory-related services for the Monad protocol.",

This significantly reduces RAM requirements and reduces the cost of running a node\u2014 creating a clear path to scalable decentralization.\n* Monad is a redesign of both the consensus and execution systems of Ethereum that preserves compatibility for EVM smart contracts and Ethereum\u2019s RPC API.\n* Optimistic Parallel Execution\n  * Monad employs optimistic parallel execution, executing transactions in parallel before previous ones are completed\u2060. Results are committed in the original order and checked against the current state to ensure accuracy.\n  * Efficiently processes blockchain transactions by executing them in parallel using multiple virtual machines, predicting dependencies to optimize scheduling, and merging results sequentially to ensure correct execution order while maximizing resource utilization.\n* A custom database for storing blockchain state, using Patricia Trie data structure, both on-disk and in-memory\u2014 reducing hardware requirements.\n* Asynchronous Execution\n  * Execution is decoupled from consensus, allowing single-shard blockchain to scale to millions of users. Execution begins on a block after consensus completes, running in parallel to the next block\u2019s consensus.\n  * In Monad, nodes come to consensus (i.e. agreement about the official ordering of transactions), without ever executing those transactions.\n  * \n* MonadBFT\n  * A custom BFT mechanism derived from HotStuff, optimized to reduce communication phases from three to two, enhancing efficiency. Its optimistically responsive design allows rounds to progress at actual network latency, improving performance.\n  * MonadBFT operates under the assumptions of partial synchrony and a maximum 33% Byzantine stake weight.\n  * A high-performance POS consensus mechanism with 1s block times on MonadDB.\n  * \n* MonadDB\n  * MonadDb is a critical component in Monad for maintaining full Ethereum compatibility while delivering high performance. It is a custom-built key-value database designed for storing authenticated blockchain data.\n  * A custom state database that significantly enhances blockchain performance by optimizing storage and access of Merkle Patricia Trie data, enabling high-performance parallel access crucial for Monad's parallel execution capabilities.\n  * MonadDB allows you to keep most of the state on SSD instead of RAM\u2014 reducing RAM requirements, costs and allowing consumer-grade hardware to participate in the network.\n* the Monad Foundation, an independent organization dedicated to encouraging the development and adoption of the Monad blockchain protocol.\u00a0\n  * The Foundation\u2019s principal activity will be to facilitate validator-led governance and community-led improvement proposals; provide developer documentation relating to the network; and engage in ecosystem development, marketing, and advisory-related services for the Monad protocol."

Fair AI addresses the challenges within the current AI landscape around data being stolen without compensation.The Masa Network is entirely open-source and permissionless.\u00a0\n\nGiving anyone the ability to contribute data and compute for rewards, and any developer the ability to access this data for their AI and data applications. Masa utilizes a staking model to stabilize the network, while ensuring the network itself is self-learning and self-evolving to ensure equitable balance amongst all contributors.Fair AI is a new economic system to power the next-generation of AI innovation.\n\n# Features\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/f8e830e8-d6d2-4643-a0d9-5da6e2e303a8/5abd8e34-0ab1-4af5-b1c7-6ce8353a4b2d)\n\n# Business Model\n\n# Traction\n\n[https://dune.com/masa-network/masa](https://dune.com/masa-network/masa)\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/c211ab2c-fb78-40d1-8ce3-2cc8a50c5b66/55161a22-82db-466c-96be-38eb4fa06924)\n\n**(At the time of Coinlist Sale)**\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/c1b428cb-8f40-414f-afe7-1bd669ded36d/1e157444-06f9-46fa-8cbf-6d01177486dd)\n\n# Team\n\n# Investors\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/b524c35c-5ab3-40e5-98c1-4052a9dd0554/e84a403d-2eb9-4228-a1b6-bb6a73d3da59)\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/167ad655-e2f4-46f7-bb80-56ab980aed94/0af10784-737e-4274-ae57-e940477cdd01)\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/3cf35865-d73e-4396-bbf0-566d7a74b617/21d316df-2938-4663-8c8b-cd48f1292c3e)\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/cfc4a3f4-7983-4e7d-aa9a-5b2991ca9087/3cec8497-34f8-4f83-a00d-fad46ca7731e)\n\n# Tokenomics\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/ff8a5368-0207-48c8-a586-7eaba685c52a/6466ba2c-5fbd-41d1-9f64-5657aa2822f4)\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/473409c8-0412-40ef-af20-5d4df5bc265a/b27be09d-2ee3-4730-8c33-890f153e3237)\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/9ca508b5-7f9f-4133-bc84-45c08bb1f8de/f8833eb4-3bb8-4ba3-a8e1-8e938cd95f44)\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/fcf5d9c8-3f26-4111-a83e-33df6ba63de4/95ee5813-2c53-456a-9936-d8ef0be6d1b7)\n\n# Conclusion"

So I think let's make this more modern and try to condense as much information as possible using the examples below.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n* The holder pie chart and creator/owner top 10 and others can be merged with a top 10 holder ratio to be just one row, similar to how the Degen audit has it in the example below. That says top 10 and then just has 13% with a checkmark, and that's that's literally all we need.

So I think let's make this more modern and try to condense as much information as possible using the examples below.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n* The holder pie chart and creator/owner top 10 and others can be merged with a top 10 holder ratio to be just one row, similar to how the Degen audit has it in the example below. That says top 10 and then just has 13% with a checkmark, and that's that's literally all we need. And maybe a checkmark for if the creator is still holding and if the owner is still holding.\n\n  ![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/1f9879ae-c711-4d35-8fed-510c8228824c/b3d1b77b-3b24-4566-90d1-20e7ad829961)\n\n**Change to one of these**\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/8f381d74-710e-451c-96f9-fd7e8c7d00c0/e81aa8d4-c463-4b4e-86ac-27bdd0625ec0)\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/0475355b-8304-4b25-805c-681b360accfa/144c3016-363f-439b-a423-ca46b6498221)\n\n* Liqudity\n\n  ![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/8312be2f-fb7c-49f9-8b7f-72e713212736/7edc664b-88b2-4672-870f-2cc48abcf91a)\n\n**Change to one of these**\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/8f51f86d-91ea-4444-bd71-8067d61df6ca/7eb054ba-6097-4e71-a1cd-5288c69a3114)\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/b7bdfa64-ac31-4d95-9d86-3090c6d0e0e4/47a54b3f-9bc7-4557-a98e-75b4fb569ec4)\n\n**Full screen:**\n\n![jam-full-url-screenshot](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/2ced713e-9b79-44fd-85f6-4b24cf7b91d4/b5cf47d6-8d19-45dc-8e79-240710c55145)\n\n---\n\n**Website URL:**\n[https://app.tokenmetrics.com/en/vaderai-by-virtuals](https://app.tokenmetrics.com/en/vaderai-by-virtuals)\n\n**Device and browser info:**\nArc 131.0.6778.265 (1728x1080) | macOS (arm) 15.2.0\n\n**Date and time:**\nFebruary 3rd 2025 | 10:23pm UTC\n\n**View developer information (console logs, network requests & timing):**\n[jam.dev/c/3acbc2ca-d0db-448d-b57d-207a1a4cbc85](https://jam.dev/c/3acbc2ca-d0db-448d-b57d-207a1a4cbc85)\n\n---\n\n*Captured with* [*jam.dev*](https://jam.dev?utm_source=linear&utm_medium=integration&utm_campaign=captured_with_link_2022_11)"

This is due to **high turnover in the grade** itself, rather than the selection/index strategy. \n\nThe turnover on the v4 grades seems significantly lower, though there is still room for improvement. All in all, we should see a left-skewed distribution in the end, indicating that (a) the index holdings do not change too frequently and (b) we don't \"change up our mind\" with the token grade within a day.\n\n\\*\\* that being said though, we should keep in mind that our payment structure is fees-based, which means we cannot have a grade that changes infrequently (as this would yield few txns, thus low fees). My opinion is to opt for a 5-7d holding period on average.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts as well - will resume the analysis with the v4 trader grades as soon as @talhacagri has them ready\n\ncc @ian @talhacagri @chao ",

        "description": "### Problem\n\nPrior efforts and initiatives have explored in deploying custom fine-tuned LLM model that satisfies the following criteria: \n\n* gives high quality response (no hallucination)\n* cheaper than GPT-4o or o3-mini (more cost efficient) in inference cost\n* does not incur a lot of cost every time we need to do fine tuning\n\nThe custom fine-tuned model hosting system must also be able to host multiple fine-tuned models. \n\nThis has proven to be difficult because in companies like Cloudflare, their cost-efficient solution is because they only provide 'base models', meaning that we also share the infra cost with other users who is also conducting inference on these 'base models'.\n\nIf we ask it to host our fine-tuned model, from Cloudflare's perspective, we should also be burdened with hefty infra cost as that fine-tuned custom model is only used by 1 specific party. It should allocate GPU and other resources just for 1 specific client (us). \n\nFurthermore, fine-tuning in itself is not cheap - we have LoRaX method (Cloudflare also has it) but it can only serve small lightweight models with less than 10 000 token context window. Fine-tuning premium models with large parameters often require us to do it ourseleves in Google Colab, or other environments where we can momentarily rent GPU to do fine-tuning. \n\n### Solution\n\nWe should think about whether there are alternative solution to fine tuning. If our problem is to 'match' the 'style' and 'tone' of a particular individual, KOL, or entity, then there is a proposed solution that we could try before deciding to do fine-tuning. \n\nGemini 2.0-Flash is a model that is often underestimated. It is not topping any benchmark, but there are a few characteristics that made it stellar among other proprietary LLMs: \n\nIt's quality is on-par with gpt-4o\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/c08510ff-5474-4e02-8078-f8b07c356ca0/21bcd21c-fa34-40f4-9d82-82b895182b67)\n\nWhile it's price is very cheap compared to GPT-4o\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/90609bc5-985a-4c6c-9d19-00ba2a28bc80/28b755ec-edc4-4a95-bccc-567b83e415be)\n\nAnd it has 1 000 000 context window, much more than other LLMs that we have today. \n\nWith this, we can do the following: \n\n* Feed Gemini-2.0-Flash with 'examples' of 'KOL styles' or 'tone' that it should mimic\n* Feed Gemini-2.0-Flash with the information that it should convey (facts, arguments, snowflake/perplexity data, etc)\n* Ask Gemini-2.0-Flash to answer questions or convey arguments in the style of the given examples\n\nThis approach is possible because of the large context window of Gemini 2.0-Flash\n\nThis solution, if it works, is not only cost effective, but also does not require us to fine tune anything.

It should allocate GPU and other resources just for 1 specific client (us). \n\nFurthermore, fine-tuning in itself is not cheap - we have LoRaX method (Cloudflare also has it) but it can only serve small lightweight models with less than 10 000 token context window. Fine-tuning premium models with large parameters often require us to do it ourseleves in Google Colab, or other environments where we can momentarily rent GPU to do fine-tuning. \n\n### Solution\n\nWe should think about whether there are alternative solution to fine tuning. If our problem is to 'match' the 'style' and 'tone' of a particular individual, KOL, or entity, then there is a proposed solution that we could try before deciding to do fine-tuning. \n\nGemini 2.0-Flash is a model that is often underestimated. It is not topping any benchmark, but there are a few characteristics that made it stellar among other proprietary LLMs: \n\nIt's quality is on-par with gpt-4o\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/c08510ff-5474-4e02-8078-f8b07c356ca0/21bcd21c-fa34-40f4-9d82-82b895182b67)\n\nWhile it's price is very cheap compared to GPT-4o\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/90609bc5-985a-4c6c-9d19-00ba2a28bc80/28b755ec-edc4-4a95-bccc-567b83e415be)\n\nAnd it has 1 000 000 context window, much more than other LLMs that we have today. \n\nWith this, we can do the following: \n\n* Feed Gemini-2.0-Flash with 'examples' of 'KOL styles' or 'tone' that it should mimic\n* Feed Gemini-2.0-Flash with the information that it should convey (facts, arguments, snowflake/perplexity data, etc)\n* Ask Gemini-2.0-Flash to answer questions or convey arguments in the style of the given examples\n\nThis approach is possible because of the large context window of Gemini 2.0-Flash\n\nThis solution, if it works, is not only cost effective, but also does not require us to fine tune anything.

        "title": "Enhance X Agent to Self-Improve Using X API Post Metrics and Optimize Prompts for X Algorithm",
        "description": "**Description**\n\nUpdate the X Agent to autonomously enhance its performance on X by retrieving and analyzing post engagement metrics available via the X API, identifying traits of high-performing posts, and refining its prompt generation to align with the X algorithm\u2019s priorities. This will maximize visibility and engagement based on directly accessible data.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe X API provides specific post metrics that reflect engagement and align with the X algorithm\u2019s focus on interaction and relevance. Available metrics include:\n\n* **Retweets**: Number of times a post is retweeted (via retweet_count).\n* **Likes**: Number of likes a post receives (via favorite_count).\n* **Replies**: Number of replies to a post (via reply_count, available in some contexts or inferred from conversation data).\n* **Impressions**: Number of times a post is seen (via impressions, available for owned posts with elevated API access).\n* **Quote Tweets**: Number of times a post is quoted (via quote_count).\n\nThese metrics are key signals for the X algorithm, driving post visibility. \n\nNote: Some metrics (e.g., bookmarks, profile clicks, video view duration) are not consistently available via the public X API and are excluded here unless elevated access is confirmed.\n\n**Objective**\n\nEnable the X Agent to:\n\n1. Retrieve post metrics via the X API for its own posts and replies.\n2. Analyze patterns in high-performing posts (e.g., text length, media use, hashtags).\n3. Adjust prompt generation to favor traits that boost retweets, likes, replies, impressions, and quote tweets.\n4. Iterate continuously to improve engagement within API limits.\n\n**Tasks**\n\n1. **Metric Collection**\n   * Use X API endpoints (e.g., GET /2/tweets/:id, GET /2/users/:id/tweets) to fetch metrics for X Agent posts: retweet_count, favorite_count, reply_count, impressions (if accessible), and quote_count.\n   * Store data in a structured database (e.g., time-series DB, etc.) with post content and metadata (e.g., text, media, timestamp).\n2. **Performance Analysis**\n   * Create a scoring function weighting X API metrics (e.g., replies = +5, retweets = +3, likes = +1, impressions = +0.001, quote tweets = +4). Adjust weights based on empirical results and algorithm priorities.\n   * Correlate post traits (e.g., length, sentiment, media) with engagement scores to identify success patterns.\n3. **Prompt Optimization**\n   * Implement a feedback loop where high-scoring traits (e.g., \u201cposts with questions get 3x replies\u201d) update the agent\u2019s prompt logic.\n   * Use a rule-based or lightweight ML approach to refine prompts (e.g., \u201cincrease question frequency, add images\u201d) while maintaining core functionality.\n   * Limit adjustments to API-available metrics to ensure feasibility.\n4. **Testing & Iteration**\n   * Test the updated agent with 50 posts, comparing pre- and post-optimization metrics (e.g., retweets, likes).\n   * Log trends and tweak scoring or prompt rules based on results.\n   * Schedule weekly reviews to adapt to API or algorithm changes.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**\n\n* X Agent retrieves and logs retweet_count, favorite_count, reply_count, impressions (if available), and quote_count for every post via the X API.\n* Identifies at least 3 traits of high-performing posts (e.g., \u201chashtags boost retweets by 50%\u201d) after analyzing 100 posts.\n* Prompt updates increase average engagement (e.g., 20% more retweets or likes) within 30 days.\n* System operates within X API rate limits and requires minimal manual oversight.\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n* X API access with sufficient permissions (e.g., v2 API, elevated access for impressions).\n* Existing X Agent codebase for prompt generation.\n* Data storage for metrics and analysis\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Confirm API access level; impressions may require elevated access (e.g., Academic or Enterprise tier).\n* Exclude metrics like bookmarks or video views unless API documentation confirms availability.\n* Use simple heuristics initially (e.g., replies > retweets > likes) and refine with data.\n* Monitor X API updates via posts on X or developer docs to adapt to changes.",

      "full_context": "Title: Enhance X Agent to Self-Improve Using X API Post Metrics and Optimize Prompts for X Algorithm\n\nDescription:\n**Description**\n\nUpdate the X Agent to autonomously enhance its performance on X by retrieving and analyzing post engagement metrics available via the X API, identifying traits of high-performing posts, and refining its prompt generation to align with the X algorithm\u2019s priorities. This will maximize visibility and engagement based on directly accessible data.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe X API provides specific post metrics that reflect engagement and align with the X algorithm\u2019s focus on interaction and relevance. Available metrics include:\n\n* **Retweets**: Number of times a post is retweeted (via retweet_count).\n* **Likes**: Number of likes a post receives (via favorite_count).\n* **Replies**: Number of replies to a post (via reply_count, available in some contexts or inferred from conversation data).\n* **Impressions**: Number of times a post is seen (via impressions, available for owned posts with elevated API access).\n* **Quote Tweets**: Number of times a post is quoted (via quote_count).\n\nThese metrics are key signals for the X algorithm, driving post visibility. \n\nNote: Some metrics (e.g., bookmarks, profile clicks, video view duration) are not consistently available via the public X API and are excluded here unless elevated access is confirmed.\n\n**Objective**\n\nEnable the X Agent to:\n\n1. Retrieve post metrics via the X API for its own posts and replies.\n2. Analyze patterns in high-performing posts (e.g., text length, media use, hashtags).\n3. Adjust prompt generation to favor traits that boost retweets, likes, replies, impressions, and quote tweets.\n4. Iterate continuously to improve engagement within API limits.\n\n**Tasks**\n\n1. **Metric Collection**\n   * Use X API endpoints (e.g., GET /2/tweets/:id, GET /2/users/:id/tweets) to fetch metrics for X Agent posts: retweet_count, favorite_count, reply_count, impressions (if accessible), and quote_count.\n   * Store data in a structured database (e.g., time-series DB, etc.) with post content and metadata (e.g., text, media, timestamp).\n2. **Performance Analysis**\n   * Create a scoring function weighting X API metrics (e.g., replies = +5, retweets = +3, likes = +1, impressions = +0.001, quote tweets = +4). Adjust weights based on empirical results and algorithm priorities.\n   * Correlate post traits (e.g., length, sentiment, media) with engagement scores to identify success patterns.\n3. **Prompt Optimization**\n   * Implement a feedback loop where high-scoring traits (e.g., \u201cposts with questions get 3x replies\u201d) update the agent\u2019s prompt logic.\n   * Use a rule-based or lightweight ML approach to refine prompts (e.g., \u201cincrease question frequency, add images\u201d) while maintaining core functionality.\n   * Limit adjustments to API-available metrics to ensure feasibility.\n4. **Testing & Iteration**\n   * Test the updated agent with 50 posts, comparing pre- and post-optimization metrics (e.g., retweets, likes).\n   * Log trends and tweak scoring or prompt rules based on results.\n   * Schedule weekly reviews to adapt to API or algorithm changes.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**\n\n* X Agent retrieves and logs retweet_count, favorite_count, reply_count, impressions (if available), and quote_count for every post via the X API.\n* Identifies at least 3 traits of high-performing posts (e.g., \u201chashtags boost retweets by 50%\u201d) after analyzing 100 posts.\n* Prompt updates increase average engagement (e.g., 20% more retweets or likes) within 30 days.\n* System operates within X API rate limits and requires minimal manual oversight.\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n* X API access with sufficient permissions (e.g., v2 API, elevated access for impressions).\n* Existing X Agent codebase for prompt generation.\n* Data storage for metrics and analysis\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Confirm API access level; impressions may require elevated access (e.g., Academic or Enterprise tier).\n* Exclude metrics like bookmarks or video views unless API documentation confirms availability.\n* Use simple heuristics initially (e.g., replies > retweets > likes) and refine with data.\n* Monitor X API updates via posts on X or developer docs to adapt to changes."

This utility should provide reusable methods for executing queries, loading data, and managing connections efficiently.\n\n### **Requirements:**\n\n* The utility should support query execution, data ingestion, and schema management.\n* It should handle connection pooling and authentication securely.\n* Follow the same structure and design principles as `SnowflakeUtility`.\n* Ensure robust error handling and logging for better debugging.\n* Implement unit tests to validate core functionalities.\n\n### **Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n* `StarRocksUtility` class is implemented with necessary methods for interacting with StarRocks.\n* It follows the existing patterns used in `SnowflakeUtility`.\n* Secure connection handling using appropriate credentials (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets if applicable).\n* Logging and error handling are in place.\n* Unit tests cover key methods with various test cases."

They primarily had data on large caps.\n\nSeeing here they support 1,155 tokens.\n\n[Supported Assets | Glassnode Docs](https://docs.glassnode.com/data/supported-assets)\n\nBut for specific metrics, they have a very small sample size. For instance for the metric Percent of Addresses in Profit, they only have these limited assets.\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/2189e5ce-46f5-413e-b089-ed17d0854fd7/ccfc91db-915c-487d-a3d4-9642516c5438)\n\nGiven that we already onchain data for EVM, SOL, and other chains via our subscription to Bitquery. \n\nIt might be more cost effective for us to find the top fundamental metrics we need and query them and store them in our database for each token. @jake or @andrew could do this after the Star Rocks migration.\n\n[https://docs.glassnode.com/data/metric-catalog#essential-metrics](https://docs.glassnode.com/data/metric-catalog#essential-metrics)\n\nHere are some sample metrics we could track, with some of them being very simple.\n\n 1. **Active Addresses:** (Essential Metrics) - A higher number of active addresses suggests increased network usage and adoption. Consistent growth over time is a positive signal.\n 2. **New Addresses:** (Essential Metrics) - This metric shows the rate at which new users are joining the network. An increasing number of new addresses can indicate growing interest in the altcoin.\n 3. **Transaction Count:** (Essential Metrics) - A higher transaction count indicates more activity on the network, suggesting a healthy and active ecosystem.\n 4. **Average Transaction Size:** (Essential Metrics) - Monitoring the average transaction size can offer insights into network usage patterns. For instance, an increase in average transaction size may point to growing institutional involvement.\n 5. **Fees (Total):** (Essential Metrics) - While high fees can sometimes be a negative, a healthy level of total fees suggests that there is demand to use the blockchain and that the network can sustain itself.\n 6. **Supply in Smart Contracts:** (Essential Metrics) - Measures the amount of coin supply locked inside smart contracts. A rising supply locked in smart contracts is often interpreted as a bullish signal, as it reflects increasing utilization in decentralized finance (DeFi) or other applications\n 7. **Exchange Net Position Change:** (Essential Metrics) - This metric tracks the net flow of tokens into or out of exchanges. Consistent outflows can suggest accumulation by long-term holders, while inflows might indicate selling pressure.\n 8. **Top Holders Balance:** (Essential Metrics) - Analyzing the balances of the top holders can provide insight into the distribution of wealth and potential centralization risks.\n 9. **Realized Cap:** (Essential Metrics) - Realized Cap attempts to value the network based on the price that each coin last moved on-chain, therefore filtering out lost or dormant coins.\n10. **NVT Ratio (Network Value to Transactions Ratio):** (Essential Metrics) - The NVT Ratio is a valuation metric which is described as the crypto equivalent of the P/E ratio. It is calculated as the ratio of Market Cap divided by Transacted Volume.\n\n### Citations:\n\n1. [https://docs.glassnode.com/data/metric-catalog](https://docs.glassnode.com/data/metric-catalog)",

The only issue though is the sparsity of this data in our database, which makes them essentially unusable (the performance of those was discussed in depth, and also visualized in the previous Investor Index which was relying on these metrics and was frankly horrible). This is the reason I've been stressing over getting this data directly from a third-party provider like Glassnode, as even the base tier (T1) can greatly enhance our investor grades.\n\nThat being said, I know it's an expensive commitment ($833/mo for API access, billed yearly) though judging solely by its cost we can easily tell its usefulness. Digging deeper reading their newsletter and analysis, there is clearly alpha to be extracted from this data, which can be used across all our offerings - research/x/web agents, trading agents, rankings and of course, indices. \n\nWe may consider contacting them for a demo data batch, then use it in our analysis pipelines to visually tell whether it fits our needs.

It also optimizes content management across Twitter, Discord, and Telegram platforms, leading to more efficient communication and engagement.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. **Single Post Generation:** When a token exists in multiple categories, only one combined post is created.\n2. **Comprehensive Content:** The merged post accurately includes all relevant categories (e.g., highlights both Top Performer status and recent bullish trends).\n3. **Consistent Display:** The unified post is consistently displayed across Twitter, Discord, and Telegram platforms.\n4. **No Duplication:** Duplicate posts for the same token in overlapping categories are eliminated.\n5. **Testing & Validation:** Comprehensive testing is performed to ensure the merged posts function correctly across all specified platforms."

        "description": "[https://youtu.be/2n3IUg97paE?si=rVTdLsiV4sQpOo9m](https://youtu.be/2n3IUg97paE?si=rVTdLsiV4sQpOo9m)\n\nWe need to integrate LangSmith pytest functionality into our TMAI agent to enable robust unit testing for our LLM components. This will allow us to benchmark our chain in pytest, assert aggregate metrics to ensure quality, and incorporate LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation using our existing feedback rubric in LangSmith.\n\n## Steps:\n\n 1. Install required dependencies:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install -U langsmith pytest\n    ```\n 2. Set up LangSmith environment variables:\n\n    ```bash\n    export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true\n    export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your-langsmith-api-key>\n    ```\n 3. Create a new test file (e.g., `test_tmai_agent.py`) in the tests directory.\n 4. Import necessary modules:\n\n    ```python\n    from langsmith import traceable\n    from langsmith.evaluation import RunEvaluator\n    from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator\n    ```\n 5. Decorate the TMAI agent function with `@traceable`:\n\n    ```python\n    @traceable\n    def tmai_agent(input: str) -> str:\n        # Existing agent logic here\n        pass\n    ```\n 6. Write pytest functions using the LangSmith `@unit` decorator:\n\n    ```python\n    from langsmith import unit\n    \n    @unit\n    def test_tmai_agent_response():\n        result = tmai_agent(\"Test input\")\n        assert len(result) > 0\n    ```\n 7. Implement LLM-as-a-Judge evaluator using our existing feedback rubric:\n\n    ```python\n    llm_judge_evaluator = load_evaluator(\"labeled_criteria\", criteria=our_existing_rubric)\n    ```\n 8. Add pytest functions to assess aggregate metrics and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation:\n\n    ```python\n    def test_tmai_agent_performance():\n        results = client.run_on_dataset(\n            dataset_name=\"tmai_test_set\",\n            llm_or_chain_factory=tmai_agent,\n            evaluation=[llm_judge_evaluator],\n        )\n        assert results.aggregate_metrics[\"mean_score\"] > 0.8\n    ```\n 9. Implement a correction flow for LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations:\n\n    ```python\n    def review_and_correct_evaluations(evaluation_results):\n        for result in evaluation_results:\n            # Review LLM-as-Judge evaluation\n            human_correction = get_human_correction(result)\n            if human_correction:\n                # Store correction as few-shot example\n                store_correction_as_example(human_correction)\n    ```\n10. Update the CI/CD pipeline to run pytest with LangSmith integration.\n11. Set up a periodic review process to align LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations with human preferences:\n    * Schedule regular review sessions to check LLM-as-a-Judge performance\n    * Use LangSmith's annotation queues for efficient human feedback collection\n    * Continuously update few-shot examples based on human corrections\n\n## Resources:\n\n* LangSmith Documentation: [https://docs.smith.langchain.com/](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/)\n* Pytest Documentation: [https://docs.pytest.org/](https://docs.pytest.org/)\n* LangSmith Pytest Integration Tutorial: [https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/pytest](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/pytest)\n* LangSmith LLM-as-a-Judge Guide: [https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/llm_as_judge](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/llm_as_judge)\n\n## Additional Notes:\n\n* Ensure proper error handling and edge case testing in the unit tests.\n* Use LangSmith's trace viewer for debugging and analysis.\n* Regularly update the test dataset to cover new scenarios and edge cases.\n* Monitor the alignment between LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations and human preferences, adjusting the rubric and few-shot examples as needed.\n* Leverage LangSmith's self-improving evaluators to continuously refine the LLM-as-a-Judge performance\\[1\\]\\[2\\].\n\nSources\n\n\\[1\\] LangChain Introduces Self-Improving Evaluators for LLM-as-a-Judge [https://blockchain.news/news/langchain-self-improving-evaluators-llm-judge](https://blockchain.news/news/langchain-self-improving-evaluators-llm-judge)\n\n\\[2\\] Aligning LLM-as-a-Judge with Human Preferences - LangChain Blog [https://blog.langchain.dev/aligning-llm-as-a-judge-with-human-preferences/](https://blog.langchain.dev/aligning-llm-as-a-judge-with-human-preferences/)\n\n\\[3\\] Workshop 3: Instrumenting & Evaluating LLMs - Christian Mills [https://christianjmills.com/posts/mastering-llms-course-notes/workshop-003/](https://christianjmills.com/posts/mastering-llms-course-notes/workshop-003/)\n\n\\[4\\] Evaluation concepts | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f LangSmith - LangChain [https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/concepts](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/concepts)\n\n\\[5\\] How to define an LLM-as-a-judge evaluator | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f LangSmith [https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/llm_as_judge](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/llm_as_judge)\n\n\\[6\\] Mastering Evaluations in LangSmith: Enhancing LLM Performance [https://www.codecontent.net/blog/enhancing-llm-performance](https://www.codecontent.net/blog/enhancing-llm-performance)\n\n\\[7\\] Evaluation - LangChain [https://www.langchain.com/evaluation](https://www.langchain.com/evaluation)\n\n\\[8\\] How to perform LangSmith Evaluations | LangChain posted on the ...

        "description": "**Description**\n\nTo ensure our real-time analytics platform meets performance standards under load and is optimized for search engines, we need to integrate self-hosted k6 load tests into our CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. \n\nThese tests should enforce specific thresholds for p90, p95, and p99 response times to validate API performance. \n\nAdditionally, we should follow industry best practices for performance and pagespeed to enhance the platform's speed, scalability, and visibility.\n\n**Tasks**\n\n1. **Configure k6 tests to measure p90, p95, and p99 response times:**\n   * Use k6\u2019s built-in http module to send requests and measure response times.\n   * Leverage the thresholds feature in the k6 test script to track these percentiles. Example configuration:\n\n     javascript\n\n     ```javascript\n     import http from 'k6/http';\n     import { check } from 'k6';\n     \n     export let options = {\n       thresholds: {\n         'http_req_duration': ['p(90)<500', 'p(95)<1000', 'p(99)<2000'],\n       },\n     };\n     \n     export default function () {\n       let res = http.get('https://your-analytics-platform.com/api/data');\n       check(res, { 'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200 });\n     }\n     ```\n2. **Integrate k6 tests into our GitHub Actions workflow:**\n   * Add a step to the existing GitHub Actions workflow to run the k6 tests on the self-hosted runner.\n   * Trigger the tests after deploying to a staging environment to validate performance.\n   * Example workflow configuration:\n\n     yaml\n\n     ```\n     name: Performance Tests\n     on:\n       push:\n         branches: [main]\n     jobs:\n       performance-test:\n         runs-on: self-hosted\n         steps:\n           - name: Checkout code\n             uses: actions/checkout@v3\n           - name: Run k6 tests\n             run: k6 run test.js\n     ```\n3. **Define and enforce thresholds for p90, p95, and p99:**\n   * Collaborate with the team to define acceptable thresholds. \n     \n     Recommended starting points for a real-time analytics platform:\n     * p90 < 500ms\n     * p95 < 1s (1000ms)\n     * p99 < 2s (2000ms)\n   * Update the k6 test script to fail if these thresholds are exceeded, ensuring the pipeline fails when performance standards are not met.\n4. **Report test results:**\n   * Ensure k6 test output is visible in the GitHub Actions logs for easy review.\n   * Optionally, integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Grafana Cloud k6, New Relic) for enhanced visibility using k6\u2019s output options (e.g., --out influxdb).\n\n**Industry Best Practices**\n\n**Performance Best Practices**\n\n* **Response Times:** Aim for sub-second API response times: p90 < 500ms, p95 < 1s, p99 < 2s to ensure fast data delivery.\n* **Scalability:** Design the system to handle peak traffic using horizontal scaling (e.g., adding more servers or containers).\n* **Caching:** Implement caching (e.g., Redis or in-memory caches) for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.\n* **Database Optimization:** Use indexing, partitioning, and optimized queries to manage large datasets efficiently.\n* **Network Optimization:** Minimize latency by optimizing network routes and using a CDN for static assets if serving a global audience.\n\n**SEO Best Practices**\n\n* **Page Speed:** Ensure web pages load in under 2 seconds. Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to identify and fix bottlenecks.\n* **Mobile Optimization:** Make the platform responsive and fast on mobile devices, as Google prioritizes mobile-first indexing.\n* **Content Optimization:** Incorporate relevant keywords (e.g., \u201creal-time analytics,\u201d \u201cperformance dashboards\u201d) in titles, headers, and meta descriptions. Use structured data (e.g., JSON-LD) to enhance search engine understanding.\n* **User Experience:** Design intuitive navigation, clear calls to action (e.g., \u201cView Live Data\u201d), and engaging visuals to reduce bounce rates and improve dwell time.\n* **Technical SEO:** Use a proper robots.txt file and XML sitemaps to guide search engine crawlers. Implement canonical URLs to avoid duplicate content issues.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**\n\n* k6 tests are successfully integrated into the GitHub Actions pipeline and enforce p90, p95, and p99 response time thresholds.\n* The pipeline fails if any percentile exceeds its defined threshold, preventing deployment of underperforming code.\n* Test results are clearly reported in the pipeline logs.\n* The platform follows the outlined performance and SEO best practices to ensure fast, scalable data delivery and optimal web visibility.",

Example configuration:\n\n     javascript\n\n     ```javascript\n     import http from 'k6/http';\n     import { check } from 'k6';\n     \n     export let options = {\n       thresholds: {\n         'http_req_duration': ['p(90)<500', 'p(95)<1000', 'p(99)<2000'],\n       },\n     };\n     \n     export default function () {\n       let res = http.get('https://your-analytics-platform.com/api/data');\n       check(res, { 'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200 });\n     }\n     ```\n2. **Integrate k6 tests into our GitHub Actions workflow:**\n   * Add a step to the existing GitHub Actions workflow to run the k6 tests on the self-hosted runner.\n   * Trigger the tests after deploying to a staging environment to validate performance.\n   * Example workflow configuration:\n\n     yaml\n\n     ```\n     name: Performance Tests\n     on:\n       push:\n         branches: [main]\n     jobs:\n       performance-test:\n         runs-on: self-hosted\n         steps:\n           - name: Checkout code\n             uses: actions/checkout@v3\n           - name: Run k6 tests\n             run: k6 run test.js\n     ```\n3. **Define and enforce thresholds for p90, p95, and p99:**\n   * Collaborate with the team to define acceptable thresholds. \n     \n     Recommended starting points for a real-time analytics platform:\n     * p90 < 500ms\n     * p95 < 1s (1000ms)\n     * p99 < 2s (2000ms)\n   * Update the k6 test script to fail if these thresholds are exceeded, ensuring the pipeline fails when performance standards are not met.\n4. **Report test results:**\n   * Ensure k6 test output is visible in the GitHub Actions logs for easy review.\n   * Optionally, integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Grafana Cloud k6, New Relic) for enhanced visibility using k6\u2019s output options (e.g., --out influxdb).\n\n**Industry Best Practices**\n\n**Performance Best Practices**\n\n* **Response Times:** Aim for sub-second API response times: p90 < 500ms, p95 < 1s, p99 < 2s to ensure fast data delivery.\n* **Scalability:** Design the system to handle peak traffic using horizontal scaling (e.g., adding more servers or containers).\n* **Caching:** Implement caching (e.g., Redis or in-memory caches) for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.\n* **Database Optimization:** Use indexing, partitioning, and optimized queries to manage large datasets efficiently.\n* **Network Optimization:** Minimize latency by optimizing network routes and using a CDN for static assets if serving a global audience.\n\n**SEO Best Practices**\n\n* **Page Speed:** Ensure web pages load in under 2 seconds. Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to identify and fix bottlenecks.\n* **Mobile Optimization:** Make the platform responsive and fast on mobile devices, as Google prioritizes mobile-first indexing.\n* **Content Optimization:** Incorporate relevant keywords (e.g., \u201creal-time analytics,\u201d \u201cperformance dashboards\u201d) in titles, headers, and meta descriptions. Use structured data (e.g., JSON-LD) to enhance search engine understanding.\n* **User Experience:** Design intuitive navigation, clear calls to action (e.g., \u201cView Live Data\u201d), and engaging visuals to reduce bounce rates and improve dwell time.\n* **Technical SEO:** Use a proper robots.txt file and XML sitemaps to guide search engine crawlers. Implement canonical URLs to avoid duplicate content issues.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**\n\n* k6 tests are successfully integrated into the GitHub Actions pipeline and enforce p90, p95, and p99 response time thresholds.\n* The pipeline fails if any percentile exceeds its defined threshold, preventing deployment of underperforming code.\n* Test results are clearly reported in the pipeline logs.\n* The platform follows the outlined performance and SEO best practices to ensure fast, scalable data delivery and optimal web visibility."

The **Index Holdings** views are used across multiple sections, and the dynamically created queries were not compatible with the new logic.\n* Discussed and planned with Vasilis to **create specific views** for all layouts using holdings data. This approach ensures that all required data comes from a **single reference**, reducing complexity and improving maintainability.\n* The previous queries relied on **multiple joins**, making them difficult to handle and slow in execution. The new approach optimizes performance.\n* Tested the newly created views to ensure they function correctly.\n* Once the new views were stable, replaced all existing queries with the updated views, **improving query performance and overall code quality**.\n* Updated **endpoints and type definitions** accordingly.\n* Leveraged the **Ratings Page layout** for displaying Trader Grade and added a **new column** in the frontend to display grades across all three views (**Trader, Investor, and Index-Specific**).\n* **Tested thoroughly** to ensure the frontend remains stable and functions correctly after all changes.\n\n@ben it's done !\nJam - [https://jam.dev/c/a03f06a7-676c-4112-a408-88903635a171](https://jam.dev/c/a03f06a7-676c-4112-a408-88903635a171)",

If you\u2019re scanning dependencies instead (e.g., `package.json`), adjust the Trivy command to `trivy fs --severity HIGH,CRITICAL .`.\n* The InfluxDB/Prometheus examples assume you\u2019re using one of these with k6. Update the hostnames (e.g., `influxdb:8086`, `pushgateway:9091`) to match your setup.\n* Add secrets like `INFLUXDB_TOKEN` or `PUSHGATEWAY_URL` to your GitHub repo settings under `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`.",

name: Send Trivy results to InfluxDB\n         run: |\n           TOTAL=$(jq '.Results[].Vulnerabilities | length' trivy-results.json | awk '{s+=$1} END {print s}')\n           CRITICAL=$(jq '.Results[].Vulnerabilities[] | select(.Severity == \"CRITICAL\")' trivy-results.json | wc -l)\n           HIGH=$(jq '.Results[].Vulnerabilities[] | select(.Severity == \"HIGH\")' trivy-results.json | wc -l)\n           curl -XPOST \"http://influxdb:8086/write?db=k6_metrics\" --data-binary \\\n             \"vulnerabilities,tool=trivy,severity=total value=$TOTAL\n             vulnerabilities,tool=trivy,severity=critical value=$CRITICAL\n             vulnerabilities,tool=trivy,severity=high value=$HIGH\"\n         env:\n           INFLUXDB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.INFLUXDB_TOKEN }}\n       ```\n     * Replace `influxdb:8086` with your InfluxDB host.\n   * **Send to Prometheus** (if using Prometheus):\n     * Add a step to push metrics to a Prometheus Pushgateway:\n\n       ```yaml\n       - name: Send Trivy results to Prometheus\n         run: |\n           TOTAL=$(jq '.Results[].Vulnerabilities | length' trivy-results.json | awk '{s+=$1} END {print s}')\n           CRITICAL=$(jq '.Results[].Vulnerabilities[] | select(.Severity == \"CRITICAL\")' trivy-results.json | wc -l)\n           echo \"trivy_vulnerabilities_total $TOTAL\" | curl --data-binary @- http://pushgateway:9091/metrics/job/trivy\n           echo \"trivy_vulnerabilities_critical $CRITICAL\" | curl --data-binary @- http://pushgateway:9091/metrics/job/trivy\n         env:\n           PUSHGATEWAY_URL: ${{ secrets.PUSHGATEWAY_URL }}\n       ```\n     * Replace `pushgateway:9091` with your Pushgateway host.\n   * Add necessary secrets (e.g., `INFLUXDB_TOKEN`, `PUSHGATEWAY_URL`) to GitHub repository settings.\n   * Update all workflows to include this step after Trivy scans.\n5. **Update Grafana Dashboards**:\n   * Modify or create a Grafana dashboard to visualize Trivy metrics alongside k6 data.\n   * Example queries:\n     * InfluxDB: `SELECT \"value\" FROM \"vulnerabilities\" WHERE \"tool\" = 'trivy' AND \"severity\" = 'critical'`\n     * Prometheus: `trivy_vulnerabilities_critical`\n   * Suggested panels:\n     * Time series graph for total vulnerabilities over time.\n     * Gauge or stat panel for critical/high vulnerability counts.\n   * Ensure the dashboard is shared with the team.\n6. **Test and Validate**:\n   * Run updated workflows to confirm Trivy scans and Grafana integration work.\n   * Verify vulnerability counts match manual Trivy runs.\n   * Check Grafana reflects accurate, real-time data from Trivy scans.\n   * Document any gaps compared to Snyk for awareness.\n7. **Remove Snyk References**:\n   * Delete Snyk config files (e.g., `.snyk`), CLI installations, and workflow steps from all repos.\n   * Update team documentation to reflect the switch to Trivy and Grafana integration.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**:\n\n* Snyk is fully removed from all GitHub Actions workflows and systems.\n* Trivy is scanning dependencies and/or container images in all workflows, failing builds on critical/high vulnerabilities.\n* Trivy scan results (e.g., total vulnerabilities, critical/high counts) are sent to InfluxDB or Prometheus after every workflow run.\n* Grafana dashboards display Trivy metrics (e.g., time series of vulnerabilities, severity gauges) alongside k6 data.\n* Team is notified of the change with updated docs and a brief demo of the new setup.\n\n**Additional Notes**:\n\n* Trivy aligns with our self-hosted k6/Grafana stack, avoiding SaaS dependencies.\n* Use `aquasecurity/trivy-action` for simplicity in GitHub Actions (docs: [https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-action](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-action)).\n* Refer to Trivy docs ([https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/)) and Grafana docs ([https://grafana.com/docs/](https://grafana.com/docs/)) for guidance.\n* Adjust InfluxDB/Prometheus hostnames and secrets based on our infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n\n* This assumes your GitHub Actions workflows build or use container images (e.g., `IMAGE_NAME`). If you\u2019re scanning dependencies instead (e.g., `package.json`), adjust the Trivy command to `trivy fs --severity HIGH,CRITICAL .`.\n* The InfluxDB/Prometheus examples assume you\u2019re using one of these with k6. Update the hostnames (e.g., `influxdb:8086`, `pushgateway:9091`) to match your setup.\n* Add secrets like `INFLUXDB_TOKEN` or `PUSHGATEWAY_URL` to your GitHub repo settings under `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`."

Fix the Graph Hover Feature\n\n**Description:**  \nEnhance the graph hover functionality by applying the correct styling, displaying the current date at the top, appending percentage signs to values, and limiting numerical values to two decimal places.\n\n**Business Rationale:**  \nImproving the hover feature ensures a consistent and intuitive user experience, enabling users to interpret data accurately and efficiently, which can lead to increased user satisfaction and engagement.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n* Hover displays match the styling outlined in the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/74Zz1grTtdFlkydLSZe3q7/TMAI_task?node-id=10447-51478&t=Y7cRCTaqciPGMjoL-4).\n* The current date is prominently shown at the top of the hover.\n* All percentage values include a \"%\" sign.\n* Numerical values are rounded to two decimal places.\n* Functionality is tested and verified across all relevant devices and browsers.\n\n## 2 Fix the placement of the Buy button on the Index holding list. Please pay attention to detail. This button already exists not he Ratings page. You can copy the component from there.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-03-07 at 16.41.42.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/fb90e071-b3e4-4683-b665-0e99ff10532e/ab57363e-7fb6-49d7-a8f8-6f64800f37e9)\n\n![Screenshot 2025-03-07 at 16.42.10.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/25ee9303-88e3-45c0-b38f-e5e5825f8945/b2f1fae0-5ca8-4fe7-963b-b72eb260560d)\n\n[https://www.figma.com/design/74Zz1grTtdFlkydLSZe3q7?node-id=7923-27653#1163774107](https://www.figma.com/design/74Zz1grTtdFlkydLSZe3q7?node-id=7923-27653#1163774107)\n\n## 3\\. Implement Contextual Transaction Descriptions\n\n**Description:**\nUpdate the transaction descriptions to ensure clarity based on the type of transaction. The descriptions should follow this structure:\n\n* **Purchase** \u2192 \"Created allocation of X%\"\n* **Increase** \u2192 \"Increased position by X%\"\n* **Decrease** \u2192 \"Decreased position by X%\"\n* **Sold** \u2192 \"Liquidated full position\"\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n* Ensure the correct verb ('Increased' or 'Decreased') is applied based on the transaction type.\n* Implement logic to map each transaction type to its respective description.\n* Validate that the output makes sense within the transaction context.\n* Test with different transaction types to confirm correct behavior.\n\n[index holding - proper context - TMAI_task (Figma)](https://www.figma.com/design/74Zz1grTtdFlkydLSZe3q7/TMAI_task?node-id=10459-32612&t=TCIC3BAQHQvtHRy6-4)\n\n## 4\\.

Sorting Not Persisting Across Pages in Ratings Table\n\n**Description:**\nWhen sorting on the **Ratings Page**, the sorting only applies to the **current page**. Once the user navigates to the **second page**, and the order is not applied to the entire data set. The sorting should persist across all pages, ensuring that the entire dataset is sorted, not just the current page.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/076f68b7-581a-451f-9a52-50c6ee7ee97e](https://jam.dev/c/076f68b7-581a-451f-9a52-50c6ee7ee97e)\n\n## 6\\. Pagination in Inspired Index Holdings Table Redirects to Treemap View\n\n**Description:**\nWhen clicking on the **pagination** controls in the **Inspired Index Holdings** table, the user is unexpectedly redirected to the **Treemap View** instead of navigating through the pages of the table. This issue disrupts the expected user flow and prevents users from properly interacting with the pagination functionality.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/e2741104-7bd1-45ff-b03a-5a28a6a8ced0](https://jam.dev/c/e2741104-7bd1-45ff-b03a-5a28a6a8ced0)\n\n## 7\\. \"Back\" Button Not Working After Clicking on \"Index Holding\" or \"Index Transaction\" Tabs\n\n**Description:**\nWhen navigating to the **Index Holding** or **Index Transaction** tabs, clicking the **back button**  does not work as expected.

Sign into platform.openai.com, ensure you have API credits, and get an API key if integrating with Cursor.\n2. **Define Your Project**:\n   * Open a chat with o1 and provide a clear prompt. Include your goals, existing codebase context, and design system details. For example:\n\n     ```\n     I\u2019m building a new \"UserSettingsModal\" for a React app with an existing design system (DSButton, DSTypography, etc.) using Tailwind CSS and TypeScript. The modal should allow users to update their username and toggle dark mode. Generate a detailed specification document with:\n     - Component breakdown\n     - Props and state requirements\n     - Step-by-step implementation plan\n     - Integration points with my design system\n     ```\n3. **Refine the Output**:\n   * O1 will produce a structured spec, like:\n\n     ```\n     ### UserSettingsModal Specification\n     \n     #### Component Breakdown\n     - UserSettingsModal (parent component)\n     - DSButton (for Save/Cancel actions)\n     - DSTypography (for labels)\n     - DSInput (for username field)\n     - DSToggle (for dark mode switch)\n     \n     #### Props\n     - `isOpen: boolean` - Controls modal visibility\n     - `onClose: () => void` - Closes the modal\n     - `initialUsername: string` - Pre-filled username\n     - `onSave: (username: string, darkMode: boolean) => void` - Saves changes\n     \n     #### State\n     - `username: string` - Tracks input value\n     - `darkMode: boolean` - Tracks toggle state\n     \n     #### Implementation Steps\n     1. Create `UserSettingsModal.tsx` with a modal wrapper using Tailwind classes (e.g., `fixed inset-0`).\n     2. Add form elements using DSInput and DSToggle from the design system.\n     3. Implement state with `useState` for username and darkMode.\n     4. Use DSButton for Save/Cancel, wiring Save to `onSave`.\n     5. Integrate with existing theme context for dark mode.\n     \n     #### Integration Points\n     - Reuse `DS` components from `src/components/design-system`.\n     - Pull Tailwind utilities from `tailwind.config.js`.\n     ```\n   * Ask follow-ups like, \u201cAdd error handling for empty usernames,\u201d to refine the spec further.\n4. **Export the Spec**:\n   * Copy the markdown or text output to a file (e.g., user-settings-modal-spec.md) in your project folder for reference.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Set Up Cursor with Claude**\n\nCursor AI integrates Claude models (like 3.5 Sonnet) for code generation. Here\u2019s how to use it with your spec.\n\n1. **Configure Claude in Cursor**:\n   * Open Cursor, go to Settings > AI Models, and select Claude 3.5 Sonnet (or input an Anthropic API key if using a custom setup).\n   * Ensure your codebase is indexed (Settings > Codebase Indexing) so Claude understands your design system and structure.\n2. **Import the Spec**:\n   * Open a new file in Cursor (e.g., UserSettingsModal.tsx) and paste the spec into the Chat panel (Cmd + L) or a markdown file in your project. Reference it with @user-settings-modal-spec.md in the chat.\n3. **Prompt Claude to Implement**:\n   * In Cursor\u2019s Chat or Composer (Cmd + I), provide a prompt based on the spec:\n\n     ```\n     Using the spec in @user-settings-modal-spec.md, implement the UserSettingsModal component in TypeScript with React.

            "body": "To effectively use Cursor AI to convert Figma designs into code that integrates seamlessly with an existing codebase and design system, you\u2019ll need a structured approach that leverages Cursor\u2019s AI capabilities alongside tools like Builder.io\u2019s Visual Copilot. Below is a step-by-step guide tailored to your goal:\n\n---\n\n**1. Prepare Your Figma Design**\n\n* **Use Auto Layout**: Ensure your Figma designs utilize Auto Layout wherever possible. This helps tools like Visual Copilot interpret spacing, alignment, and responsiveness accurately, aligning with your design system\u2019s structure.\n* **Component Mapping**: If your design system is already reflected in Figma (e.g., reusable buttons, cards, or typography styles), label these components clearly and consistently with your codebase naming conventions. This aids in mapping Figma elements to existing code components.\n* **Organize Layers**: Give meaningful names to layers and frames (e.g., \"PrimaryButton\" or \"HeaderSection\") that mirror your codebase\u2019s structure. This reduces guesswork during code generation.\n\n---\n\n**2. Set Up Cursor AI and Visual Copilot**\n\n* **Install Visual Copilot**: Add the Visual Copilot plugin to Figma (available via Builder.io or the Figma Community). This tool converts Figma designs into frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular, and supports styling libraries (e.g., Tailwind, Styled Components) that might already be in your codebase.\n* **Download Cursor**: Install Cursor, an AI-powered code editor built on VS Code, which will refine and integrate the generated code into your project.\n* **Configure Your Environment**: Open your existing codebase in Cursor. Ensure it has access to your design system\u2019s component library, styles, and dependencies.\n\n---\n\n**3. Generate Initial Code with Visual Copilot**\n\n* **Select Your Design**: In Figma, open the Visual Copilot plugin, select the frame or layer you want to convert, and specify the framework and styling solution used in your codebase (e.g., \"React with Tailwind\").\n* **Provide Context**: Inform Visual Copilot about your project\u2019s context\u2014e.g., \"This is a new dashboard card for our analytics module using our design system\u2019s Card component.\" This helps it reuse existing components where possible.\n* **Export Code**: Click \"Generate Code\" to get a preview. Copy the generated code or command (depending on the workflow) for use in Cursor.\n\n---\n\n**4. Refine and Integrate with Cursor AI**\n\n* **Paste into Cursor**: Open Cursor and paste the generated code into a new or existing file in your project.\n* **Set Up Rules**: Create a .cursorrules file in your project root to enforce coding standards and patterns from your existing codebase. For example:\n\n  ```\n  // .cursorrules\n  {\n    \"useExistingComponents\": true,\n    \"componentPrefix\": \"DS\", // e.g., DSButton for design system components\n    \"styleLibrary\": \"tailwind\",\n    \"typescript\": true\n  }\n  ```\n\n  This ensures Cursor aligns the output with your design system and conventions.\n* **Refactor with AI**: Use Cursor\u2019s \u2318 K (Command + K) feature to refactor the code. For instance, prompt it with: \"Replace hardcoded styles with our design system\u2019s Tailwind classes\" or \"Map this button to our DSButton component.\"\n* **Chat for Adjustments**: Use Cursor\u2019s Chat feature to ask questions like, \"How do I integrate this with our Redux store?\" or \"Add hover states using our design system\u2019s utilities.\" Cursor will suggest precise edits based on your codebase context.\n\n---\n\n**5. Leverage Your Existing Codebase**\n\n* **Component Reuse**: If Visual Copilot didn\u2019t automatically map to your components, manually adjust the generated code in Cursor. For example, replace <button className=\"bg-blue-500\"> with <DSButton variant=\"primary\">.\n* **Context Awareness**: Cursor\u2019s strength is its understanding of your entire codebase. Highlight the generated code and use the Composer feature (e.g., \u2318 + Shift + I) to make architectural changes, like wiring it into your state management system or routing logic.\n* **Consistency Check**: Run Cursor\u2019s bug finder or semantic search to ensure the new code adheres to your codebase\u2019s patterns and doesn\u2019t introduce inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**6. Optimize for Responsiveness**\n\n* Visual Copilot generates responsive layouts, but your design system might have specific breakpoints or utilities. In Cursor, tweak the code with prompts like: \"Ensure this layout matches our 12-column grid system at all breakpoints\" or \"Use our media query helpers from the design system.\"\n\n---\n\n**7. Test and Iterate**\n\n* **Preview Locally**: Run your project locally to test the new component or page. Cursor\u2019s terminal integration lets you execute commands (e.g., npm start) without leaving the editor.\n* **Iterate with AI**: If the design drifts from the Figma spec, use Cursor\u2019s Chat to debug\u2014e.g., \"Why is this padding off by 4px compared to the design?\"\u2014and apply fixes instantly.\n* **Collaborate**: Share the updated branch with your team via GitHub. Cursor can even generate AI-assisted commit messages reflecting your design system updates.\n\n---\n\n**Tips for Success**\n\n* **Train the AI**: If your design system has unique patterns (e.g., custom hooks or naming conventions), include examples in .builderrules (for Visual Copilot) or .cursorrules (for Cursor) to improve output accuracy.\n* **Start Small**: Test the workflow with a single component (e.g., a button or card) before scaling to full pages.\n* **Sync Design Tokens**: If your design system uses tokens (e.g., colors, spacing), ensure they\u2019re defined in Figma and mirrored in your codebase\u2019s CSS variables or theme files for consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Example Workflow**\n\n1. In Figma: Design a \"UserProfileCard\" using your design system\u2019s components.\n2. In Visual Copilot: Generate React + Tailwind code, specifying \"Use our DSButton and DSTypography components.\"\n3. In Cursor: Paste the code, refactor with \u2318 K to replace generic styles with your design system\u2019s utilities, and integrate it into your ProfilePage module.\n4. Test and commit: Verify it renders correctly and push it to your repo.\n\n---\n\nBy combining Visual Copilot\u2019s Figma-to-code generation with Cursor\u2019s AI-driven refinement, you can transform designs into production-ready code that respects your existing codebase and design system. This workflow minimizes manual effort, ensures consistency, and accelerates development\u2014all while leveraging the tools\u2019 understanding of your project\u2019s unique context.",

For example, Ponke is available on both DEXes and CEXes, but with Bitquery, we only get data from Solana, whereas Coingecko aggregates total volume across all CEXes and DEXes. Another example is Turbo, which originates from Ethereum and is bridged to Solana. Bitquery treats its addresses on different chains as separate tokens, while Coingecko consolidates them into one.\n\nIn general, there aren\u2019t too many of these tokens, and most are likely available on Coingecko, which is why I recommend prioritizing it. However, Bitquery is useful for tokens that aren\u2019t listed on Coingecko\u2014typically smaller-cap, single-chain tokens that aren\u2019t traded on CEXes.\n\nThat said, we have a pipeline that merges data from both Bitquery and Coingecko.

Clicking on an index results in **freezing** and a **delayed graph update**, making it difficult to interact with.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/f31bb8b0-6573-42ef-bcaf-cc3945501199](https://jam.dev/c/f31bb8b0-6573-42ef-bcaf-cc3945501199)\n\n### **Title5: Suggestion: Add a Loading Icon When Filtering in Indices Price History**\n\n**Issue:**\nCurrently, when selecting a filter in **Indices Price History**, the graph takes time to update, but there is **no visual indication** that data is being loaded. This can make users think the filter is not working or cause them to click multiple times, leading to confusion. @ben @ayo \n\n[https://jam.dev/c/a4c3abdb-f365-4d0c-89ce-e74a7a92cf22](https://jam.dev/c/a4c3abdb-f365-4d0c-89ce-e74a7a92cf22)\n\n### **Title6:  \"How to Use Token Metrics Indices\" Redirects Back to AI Indices Page**\n\n**Summary:**\nClicking on **\"How to Use Token Metrics Indices\"** unexpectedly redirects users back to the **AI Indices** page instead of providing relevant information or guidance.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/c6eb9f49-30c0-4107-b13f-850a413c6376](https://jam.dev/c/c6eb9f49-30c0-4107-b13f-850a413c6376)\n\n### **Title7: Tooltips in Index Details Are Not Working and Misaligned on Responsive View**\n\n**Summary:**\nIn the **Index Details** section, tooltips are **not functioning properly** and appear **misaligned** in responsive view. This affects usability and prevents users from accessing important explanations.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/e51a713a-5dd1-461b-8f79-1401b4ce3d72](https://jam.dev/c/e51a713a-5dd1-461b-8f79-1401b4ce3d72)\n\n### **Title8: Incorrect Number Formatting in Index Details (Market Cap, Total Supply, etc.)**\n\n**Summary:**\nThe numbers displayed for **Market Cap, Total Supply, and other  metrics** in the **Index Details** section are not formatted properly. Instead of **compact notation (e.g., 3.45B, 2.1M, 850K)**, they are shown in full numerical format, making them harder to read.

Each function requiring data retrieves it from this common function.\n\n#### **Issues:**\n\n* For pages without pagination, a large amount of subscribed data leads to resource wastage.\n* Memory caching in RAM is fine for small amounts of data, but it impacts user performance when scaling.\n* Overlapping logic: The common function currently handles both reading and request logic, making it complex and difficult to maintain.\n\n#### **New Architecture:**\n\n* Replace memory cache with **IndexedDB** to store larger data volumes (client side).\n* Decouple logic: When subscribing a token to the socket, the function will call the token with an ID. Upon receiving a response, it will update the database. The function will not return data directly\u2014components that need data will retrieve it from the database.\n* Unified data sharing: All socket-related price data will be stored in a dedicated database. **Token details** and the **rating page** will fetch data from the same source, preventing mismatched data issues.\n\n![Socket_structure.drawio.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/29c34c33-bc80-4773-ad31-cab1ab6ae1d0/ebeab78f-d558-496d-a49f-50c24eb72c1f)\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/13royyN3OPRKb-gi92t00Zo4jS7X9sBYy/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13royyN3OPRKb-gi92t00Zo4jS7X9sBYy/view?usp=sharing)\n\nCode example:\n\n```typescript\n// Subscribe data\nexport const useSubscribeTokenPrice = (filteredData: RatingDataResponse[]) => {\n  const { getTokenPrice } = useTokenPriceV2();\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const subscribeToTokenPriceChange = (tokens: Array<RatingDataResponse>) => {\n      const tokenIds = tokens.map((token) => token.CG_ID);\n      getTokenPrice(tokenIds);\n    };\n\n    subscribeToTokenPriceChange(filteredData);\n  }, [filteredData, getTokenPrice]);\n};\n```\n\n```typescript\nexport async function getTokenSocketPrice(cgid: string): Promise<Token> {\n  const db = await initDB();\n  const tx = db.transaction(IDB_STORE.SOCKET.TOKEN_PRICE, \"readonly\");\n  const store = tx.objectStore(IDB_STORE.SOCKET.TOKEN_PRICE);\n  return store.get(cgid) || {};\n}\n\n\nexport const AutoPriceChangeDynamic = ({\n  id,\n  renderPriceChange,\n  onChange,\n}: {\n  id: string;\n  renderPriceChange: (tokenPrice: Token | undefined) => React.ReactNode;\n  onChange: (data: Token | undefined) => void;\n}) => {\n  const { data } = useQuery({\n    queryKey: [\"token-socket-price\", id],\n    queryFn: () => getTokenSocketPrice(id),\n    refetchInterval: 3000,\n  });\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (data?.cgid === id) {\n      onChange(data);\n    }\n  }, [data, id]);\n\n  return renderPriceChange(data);\n};\n```\n\ndemo:\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/f221b77b-814c-4df9-9ff5-6dde5da209dc](https://jam.dev/c/f221b77b-814c-4df9-9ff5-6dde5da209dc)\ncc @ian @suleman ",

            "body": "**Report on Privy Integration for Balance and Token List Retrieval**\n\nDuring the implementation of the Privy endpoints for retrieving user balances and token lists, I discovered that Privy does not still support this functionality. Their documentation no longer includes a wallet balance page.\n\nTo find an alternative approach, I attempted to use Viem to fetch wallet balances. However, I encountered an issue where Viem was only returning the balance of ETH and ignoring other tokens. I then tried retrieving the balances of other tokens by passing their respective contract addresses and decimals, but I consistently received an error stating that the contract *\"does not implement balanceOf.\"*\n\nGiven these challenges, I reached out to Chao, and it was confirmed that the data team already has existing endpoints for retrieving wallet balances and token lists. These endpoints allow fetching wallet balances using a wallet address and chain ID, as well as retrieving a comprehensive token list. The relevant API documentation is as follows:\n\n* **Token List:** [Token List API](https://tm-tradingbot-api.data-service.tokenmetrics.com/docs#/default/get_all_tokens_info_get_all_tokens_info_get)\n* **Wallet Balance:** [Wallet Balance API](https://tm-tradingbot-api.data-service.tokenmetrics.com/docs#/default/get_wallet_balance_get_wallet_balance_post)\n\nBased on this, the recommended approach is to use these existing data service endpoints instead of Privy or Viem, ensuring accurate and reliable balance and token retrieval.\n\n```\n/api/privy/get-wallet-balance?address=0xBFd723bA591931a260D2859fA0c6611823779dfE\n```",
