Community alignment for the model is achieved through the granular alignment feature of Loyalty Training, which integrates community inputs at every stage of the pipeline\n  * Community-ownership: AI artifacts should be collectively owned and governed by a community, ensuring that development remains permission-based and economic rewards are shared. This ownership is maintained on ownership contracts.\n  * Community-control: Community-control is defined as the ability to change the behavior of the model based on some specific prompts. This is facilitated through passive control mechanisms embedded during training, ensuring models behave predictably in response to predefined inputs.\u00a0\n* Sentient is built on two core components: the Blockchain and the AI Pipeline.\n  * Blockchain: Sentient Protocol is designed as a proof-of-stake Layer 1 (L1) blockchain to ensure scalability, low transaction costs, and optimized execution for AI-based smart contracts. Its architecture is still work in progress.\n  * The Blockchain components underpins the protocol, ensuring transparency and decentralized control over AI artifacts. It include three modules:\n    * Governance: A DAO-controlled system for decision-making on updates, alignment, and rewards.\n      * Sentient protocol will will enable various DAOs to govern updates and manage the shared economy surrounding their artifacts. The first DAO on the protocol, SentientDAO, will oversee the initial models onboarded to Sentient. ArtifactDAO functions as a versatile governance module, adaptable for governing models, agents, and tools.\n    * Ownership: Ownership of AI artifacts in the Sentient Protocol is tokenized, with each artifact linked to its own ERC-20 token contract.

Community alignment for the model is achieved through the granular alignment feature of Loyalty Training, which integrates community inputs at every stage of the pipeline\n  * Community-ownership: AI artifacts should be collectively owned and governed by a community, ensuring that development remains permission-based and economic rewards are shared. This ownership is maintained on ownership contracts.\n  * Community-control: Community-control is defined as the ability to change the behavior of the model based on some specific prompts. This is facilitated through passive control mechanisms embedded during training, ensuring models behave predictably in response to predefined inputs.\u00a0\n* Sentient is built on two core components: the Blockchain and the AI Pipeline.\n  * Blockchain: Sentient Protocol is designed as a proof-of-stake Layer 1 (L1) blockchain to ensure scalability, low transaction costs, and optimized execution for AI-based smart contracts. Its architecture is still work in progress.\n  * The Blockchain components underpins the protocol, ensuring transparency and decentralized control over AI artifacts. It include three modules:\n    * Governance: A DAO-controlled system for decision-making on updates, alignment, and rewards.\n      * Sentient protocol will will enable various DAOs to govern updates and manage the shared economy surrounding their artifacts. The first DAO on the protocol, SentientDAO, will oversee the initial models onboarded to Sentient. ArtifactDAO functions as a versatile governance module, adaptable for governing models, agents, and tools.\n    * Ownership: Ownership of AI artifacts in the Sentient Protocol is tokenized, with each artifact linked to its own ERC-20 token contract. These tokens represents the fractional ownership in the artifact, granting holders rights such as voting in ArtifactDAO decisions, receiving usage rewards and transferring owner shares.\n    * DeFi: Decentralized finance tools to support open, decentralized and fair governance and rewards for the shared AI economy.\n  * AI Pipeline: The AI pipeline serves as the foundation for developing and training loyal AI artifacts. It consists of two core procedures:\n    * Data curation: Ensuring high-quality training data is crucial for developing AI artifacts that align with community value while maintaining robustness and utility.

Opinion Labs enables anyone to create any predictions using any token, in a decentralized, permissionless way. We empower users to predict, trade, and verify truth like never before.\n\n## Solution:\n\n* O.LAB is a suite of tradable intelligence products developed by Opinion Labs.\n* Opinion Labs democratizes access to global trading by eliminating cross-market frictions and providing a seamlessly integrated platform with unified liquidity.\n* We cannot trade everything that we want to trade, leaving many long-tail opportunities out of reach. Opinion Labs empowers anyone to turn a single idea into a tradable market, unlocking access to these vast untapped opportunities.\n* API Access\n* \n\n## Innovation:\n\n* Opinion Protocol: Setting a New Standard for Prediction Markets Infrastructure\n* \n* Just as Uniswap set a new standard for token swapping and AMMs, Opinion Protocol introduces a permissionless, scalable solution for prediction markets. It simplifies market creation, enhances price discovery, and opens up seamless trading for any Dapps to plug into and participate.\n* Our product matrix includes :\n* Fully Decentralized and Permissionless Prediction Market\n  * Unlike centralized prediction markets, O.LAB functions as a fully decentralized and permissionless information liquidity infrastructure, akin to Uniswap.

Opinion Labs enables anyone to create any predictions using any token, in a decentralized, permissionless way. We empower users to predict, trade, and verify truth like never before.\n\n## Solution:\n\n* O.LAB is a suite of tradable intelligence products developed by Opinion Labs.\n* Opinion Labs democratizes access to global trading by eliminating cross-market frictions and providing a seamlessly integrated platform with unified liquidity.\n* We cannot trade everything that we want to trade, leaving many long-tail opportunities out of reach. Opinion Labs empowers anyone to turn a single idea into a tradable market, unlocking access to these vast untapped opportunities.\n* API Access\n* \n\n## Innovation:\n\n* Opinion Protocol: Setting a New Standard for Prediction Markets Infrastructure\n* \n* Just as Uniswap set a new standard for token swapping and AMMs, Opinion Protocol introduces a permissionless, scalable solution for prediction markets. It simplifies market creation, enhances price discovery, and opens up seamless trading for any Dapps to plug into and participate.\n* Our product matrix includes :\n* Fully Decentralized and Permissionless Prediction Market\n  * Unlike centralized prediction markets, O.LAB functions as a fully decentralized and permissionless information liquidity infrastructure, akin to Uniswap. Anyone can initiate any prediction markets and add liquidity using any ERC-20 tokens, allowing users to trade shares freely before the market topic is resolved. This flexibility enables humans, algorithms, and AI to actively engage in predictions and explorations of the world.\n* Consensus Oracle\n  * The consensus oracle is the second pillar of our tradable intelligence products, designed to record verifiable truths and data claims on-chain, ensuring integrity and trust in the information shared. The crypto-economic security of the oracle will be provided by a decentralized consensus of all network participants, who will be rewarded for maintaining the global truth machine throughout its many use cases in DeFi, real world assets, real world events and more.\n* \n\n## Use Case / Features:\n\n* Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) and Market Liquidity\n* Market makers play a vital role in the protocol\u2019s liquidity and efficiency.

        "description": "## 1\\. Overview\n\nThis ticket details the design and implementation plan for a referral-based rewards system integrated into our existing payment processing contract (TMAIPayment) for the tokenmetrics platform. The system is built to incentivize users to refer new customers by offering a percentage-based referral fee. It ensures robust security, gas efficiency, and upgradeability, using proven patterns and libraries.\n\n---\n\n## 2\\. Objectives\n\n* **Incentivize Referrals:** Encourage users to refer others by awarding them a fee based on payments made.\n* **Seamless Integration:** Integrate with the existing payment contract to process payments and log referrals.\n* **Gas Efficiency:** Optimize data storage and processing to reduce gas costs.\n* **Security:** Leverage upgradeable contracts and strict access controls to protect funds.\n* **Upgradeability:** Use OpenZeppelin\u2019s upgradeable contracts to allow future improvements.\n\n---\n\n## 3\\. System Requirements\n\n1. **Referral Fee Calculation:**\n   * The backend signs messages that include a referral fee percentage (expressed in basis points, e.g., 500 for 5%).\n   * The payment contract calculates the referral fee from the payment amount.\n2. **Single Referral per Payment:**\n   * Only one referral is allowed per payment. If the referral field is absent (i.e., referrer is the zero address), no referral reward is processed.\n3. **Immediate Record Removal:**\n   * Referral records must be removed immediately after a successful withdrawal to minimize gas consumption for future withdrawals.\n4. **Upgradeability:**\n   * Both the Payment and Referral contracts should be upgradeable using OpenZeppelin\u2019s upgradeable patterns.\n5. **Restricted Access:**\n   * The referral contract is callable only by the payment contract, ensuring that only valid payment-triggered referrals are logged.\n6. **Token Consistency:**\n   * The payment and referral fees use the same ERC20 token.\n7. **Withdrawal Delay:**\n   * A configurable delay (e.g., one week) must elapse before a referrer can withdraw their accumulated rewards.\n\n---\n\n## 4\\. System Architecture\n\n### 4.1 Components\n\n* **Payment Contract (TMAIPayment):**\n  * Processes payments for subscriptions.\n  * Verifies backend signatures that now include referral data.\n  * Calculates referral fees and forwards them to the Referral contract.\n  * Manages subscription creation and upgrades via a Soulbound NFT contract.\n* **Referral Contract (ReferralRewards):**\n  * Receives referral fee amounts from the Payment contract.\n  * Logs referral events with fee amount and timestamp.\n  * Enforces a withdrawal delay before allowing referrers to claim their rewards.\n  * Processes withdrawals and immediately cleans up processed records to optimize future operations.\n\n### 4.2 Integration Flow\n\n1. **Extended Payment Signature:**\n   * The backend produces a signature message containing standard payment data (user address, token, amount, nonce, etc.) and new fields:\n     * `referrer` (address): The address of the referrer.\n     * `referralFeePercentage` (uint256): The fee percentage (in basis points) to be applied on the payment amount.\n2. **Payment Contract Processing:**\n   * **Verification:** Validates the signature, nonce, and token eligibility.\n   * **Token Transfer:** Transfers the payment amount from the user.\n   * **Referral Fee Calculation:** If a valid `referrer` is provided, calculates the fee:\n\n     ```\n     feeAmount = (tokenAmount * referralFeePercentage) / 10000;\n     ```\n3. * **Referral Logging:** Transfers the calculated fee to the Referral contract and logs the referral event using the Payment contract's current nonce as a unique identifier.\n   * **Subscription Management:** Calls the appropriate functions on the Soulbound NFT contract to create or upgrade the subscription.\n   * **Nonce Increment:** Increments the user's nonce to prevent replay attacks.\n4. **Referral Contract Processing:**\n   * **Logging Referral:** The Referral contract\u2019s `logReferral` function (restricted to the Payment contract) records the referral with fee amount and the current timestamp.\n   * **Withdrawal Functionality:** When a referrer initiates a withdrawal:\n     * The contract iterates over the referrer\u2019s recorded referrals.\n     * Only records where `block.timestamp >= record.timestamp + withdrawalDelay` are eligible.\n     * Aggregates the eligible fees, transfers them to the referrer, and removes those records immediately (using an efficient swap-and-pop method).\n\n---\n\n## 5\\. Data Structures\n\n### 5.1 Payment Message (Backend-Signed)\n\n```\nstruct PaymentMessage {\n    address userAddress;            // Payer\u2019s address\n    address token;                  // ERC20 token address for payment\n    uint256 tokenAmount;            // Payment amount\n    uint256 nonce;                  // Transaction count for replay protection\n    uint8 product;                  // Subscription product identifier\n    uint8 planType;                 // Type of subscription plan\n    uint256 expiryDate;             // Subscription expiry timestamp\n    address referrer;               // (Optional) Referrer\u2019s address\n    uint256 referralFeePercentage;  // (Optional) Fee percentage in basis points\n}\n```\n\n### 5.2 Referral Record (ReferralRewards Contract)\n\n```\nstruct ReferralRecord {\n    uint256 feeAmount; // Referral reward amount in token's smallest unit\n    uint256 timestamp; // Block time when the referral was recorded\n}\n```\n\n### 5.3 Mappings\n\n* **Referral Records:**\n\n  ```\n  mapping(address => ReferralRecord[]) public referrals;\n  ```\n\n      This maps each referrer to their list of referral records.\n\n---\n\n## 6\\. Key Functions & Flow\n\n### 6.1 In Payment Contract\n\n* **processPayment(signature, isUpgrade):**\n  * Verifies the signed `PaymentMessage`.\n  * Transfers tokens and processes subscription logic.\n  * If `referrer` is provided:\n    * Calculates referral fee.\n    * Transfers fee to the Referral contract.\n    * Calls `logReferral` on the Referral contract.\n  * Increments the user's nonce.\n* **updateReferralContract(address):**\n  * Allows the contract owner to set or update the Referral contract address.\n\n### 6.2 In Referral Contract\n\n* **initialize(paymentContract, withdrawalDelay):**\n  * Sets the Payment contract address and the withdrawal delay.\n* **logReferral(referrer, feeAmount, paymentId):**\n  * Restricted to calls from the Payment contract.\n  * Records a new referral event with the fee amount and the current block timestamp.\n  * Emits a `ReferralLogged` event.\n* **withdrawReferralFees(token):**\n  * Allows referrers to withdraw accumulated fees.\n  * Iterates through the referral records; if the delay has passed, aggregates the fee.\n  * Transfers the total eligible amount to the referrer.\n  * Immediately removes the processed referral records.\n  * Emits a `ReferralWithdrawn` event.\n\n---\n\n## 7\\. Security Considerations\n\n* **Access Control:**\n  * The Referral contract\u2019s logging function uses an `onlyPaymentContract` modifier to ensure that only the Payment contract can call it.\n* **Nonce Management:**\n  * The Payment contract maintains a nonce per user to prevent replay attacks.\n* **Safe Token Transfers:**\n  * Both contracts utilize `SafeERC20Upgradeable` for secure token transfers.\n* **Withdrawal Delay Enforcement:**\n  * The enforced delay before withdrawal minimizes risks related to rapid fund extraction and flash loan exploits.\n* **Data Cleanup:**\n  * Immediate removal of referral records upon withdrawal prevents future gas-intensive iterations.\n\n---\n\n## 8\\. Gas Optimization Strategies\n\n* **Efficient Data Storage:**\n  * Using arrays with swap-and-pop removal for referral records minimizes storage costs and iteration overhead.\n* **Limited Iteration:**\n  * The withdrawal function iterates only over a referrer\u2019s records, and records are removed as soon as they are processed.\n* **Off-Chain Calculations:**\n  * The referral fee percentage is provided by the backend, reducing on-chain computational overhead.\n\n---\n\n## 9\\. Upgradeability\n\n* **Upgradeable Contracts:**\n  * Both contracts are built with OpenZeppelin\u2019s upgradeable patterns (using `Initializable` and `OwnableUpgradeable`), allowing for future enhancements without disrupting current functionality.\n* **Separation of Concerns:**\n  * The clear separation between payment processing and referral logging ensures that upgrades in one module do not inadvertently affect the other.\n\n---\n\n## 10\\. Conclusion\n\nThis design document presents a detailed plan for integrating a referral rewards system into the existing payment contract. The design meets all specified requirements:\n\n* It computes referral fees based on backend-provided percentages.\n* It processes a single referral per payment.\n* It enforces a withdrawal delay and cleans up referral records immediately upon withdrawal.\n* It ensures that both contracts are upgradeable and secure, with the referral contract callable only by the Payment contract.\n* The approach optimizes gas usage while maintaining robust security practices.\n\nThis ticket serves as a blueprint for the implementation phase.

The PDFs-reading module that I use (which was used by a node on Gumloop) has a problem and it keeps returning nothing letting the code to crash. -> I now use pdfplumber to beautifully parse the PDFs content. \n2. Currently using APIs from Lever, Google Drive and Gemini, sometimes, the code freeze due to the rate limits of these APIs and makes the automation freezed and never restarted. -> I created a service file for the code to run in the background (basically run even when I disconnect my local computer from the remote computer on digital ocean). And that service file will identify when the code freeze for a few minutes and manage to restart it, solving the freezing problem.\n\nImprovements\n\nDuring the fix, I made some improvements too:\n\n1. When monitoring the process I identify that applicants submit not only native PDF files (the ones that you can scan and copy the text) but also scanned PDF files also. So before on Gumloop, we were not able to identify and fix this. But now, I fix this by using pytesseract -> Identify these scanned PDF and convert them to image and finally use pytesseract (OCR tool) to read and return the content of the PDFs.\n2. Improvements for the speed of the automation: before Gumloop was limiting us 30 seconds of each run, but now, since we're using python, there's no limit, so we are able to catch up more quickly than before, and solve some delay issues reported by @khadijah \n\nTo sum up: it's working beautifully now and I believe the issues will be much less compared to Gumloop\n\ncc @ian @favour ",

**User Interaction Flow**:\n   * A user mentions the AI agent in Slack with a question or request\n   * The mention event is sent to the FastAPI server via Slack's Events API\n   * The agent processes the request and streams responses back to the user\n2. **FastAPI Server (**`slack_ai_bot.py`):\n   * The central component handling HTTP requests from Slack\n   * Exposes endpoints for Slack events and mention events\n   * Manages rate limiting and concurrent request processing\n   * Orchestrates the entire flow from request to response\n3. **Content Analysis System**:\n   * Uses OpenAI to analyze the user's query through the `analyze_content` function\n   * Classifies queries as simple prompts or tool-requiring prompts\n   * Determines which specific tools (data sources) are needed:\n     * Slack history retrieval\n     * Linear issue search\n     * URL content extraction\n   * Optimizes search parameters for each data source\n4. **Tool Selection & Orchestration**:\n   * Based on content analysis, selects and coordinates appropriate tools\n   * Manages parallel data retrieval from multiple sources\n   * Combines results into a unified context for response generation\n5. **Linear RAG System**:\n   * **Components**:\n     * `linear_client.py`: Custom API client for Linear project management\n     * `linear_rag_search.py`: Semantic search implementation\n     * `linear_db.py`: Database interface layer\n     * `linear_rag_embeddings.py`: Vector embedding generation\n     * `linear_rag_db_import.py`: Data import pipeline\n   * **Functionality**:\n     * Maintains up-to-date issue data from Linear\n     * Generates and stores vector embeddings for semantic search\n     * Supports complex analytical queries and natural language searches\n     * Performs specialized analyses like status reports and workload distribution\n6. **PostgreSQL with pgvector**:\n   * Stores Linear issue data in structured tables\n   * Maintains vector embeddings for semantic similarity search\n   * Enables efficient hybrid search (semantic + metadata filtering)\n   * Supports complex SQL queries for analytical functions\n7. **Response Generation**:\n   * Uses retrieved context to generate a draft response\n   * Refines and formats the response for Slack's markdown format\n   * Streams the response to the user in real-time for better UX\n\n### Data Flow\n\n1. **Request Initiation**:\n   * User mentions the agent with a question in Slack\n   * Slack sends the mention event to the `/slack/events` endpoint\n   * Server acknowledges receipt and begins asynchronous processing\n2. **Content Analysis**:\n   * Agent uses OpenAI to analyze the user's question\n   * Determines if the query is a simple question or requires tool use\n   * Identifies which specific tools are needed for this query\n   * Example classification results:\n\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"content_type\": \"prompt_requires_tool_use\",\n       \"requires_slack_channel_history\": false,\n       \"perform_RAG_on_linear_issues\": true,\n       \"urls\": [\"https://github.com/org/repo\"]\n     }\n     ```\n3. **Data Retrieval**:\n   * For Slack history: Searches channel messages with AI-optimized parameters\n   * For Linear issues: Performs RAG-based search using vector embeddings\n   * For URLs: Extracts content from GitHub, Twitter, or general websites\n   * Each data source formats results for unified context building\n4. **Linear RAG Process** (when required):\n   * **Query Optimization**: AI analyzes the query to determine optimal search parameters:\n\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"query_type\": \"status_report\",\n       \"filters\": [\n         {\"field\": \"team->key\", \"operator\": \"=\", \"value\": \"ENG\"},\n         {\"field\": \"assignee->name\", \"operator\": \"=\", \"value\": \"Sam\"}\n       ],\n       \"time_range\": {\"field\": \"updatedAt\", \"operator\": \">\", \"value\": \"7d\"}\n     }\n     ```\n   * **Vector Search**: Converts query to embedding and finds similar issues in pgvector\n   * **Hybrid Filtering**: Applies metadata filters from parameters\n   * **Result Processing**: Formats and summarizes results for inclusion in context\n5. **Response Generation**:\n   * Combines retrieved context into a unified format\n   * Generates draft response with OpenAI using the context\n   * Refines the response for clarity and Slack formatting\n   * Streams the final response to the user in real-time\n6. **Conversation Maintenance**:\n   * Stores the interaction in conversation history\n   * Preserves thread context for follow-up questions\n   * Manages history expiration for resource efficiency",

However, this approach heavily relies on the clarity and articulation of the user's input. If the question is vague or poorly phrased, the system may retrieve low-quality or irrelevant context chunks.\n\nIn contrast, **Agentic RAG introduces a reasoning layer** where the agent can evaluate the quality of the retrieved information. If the initial results are insufficient, the agent can **reformulate the query** for improved retrieval. Additionally, it can incorporate **web search capabilities**, enabling it to identify and address queries that fall outside the existing knowledge base. This makes the system more flexible, intelligent, and better aligned with real user needs.",

**User Interaction Flow**:\n   * A user mentions the AI agent in Slack with a question or request\n   * The mention event is sent to the FastAPI server via Slack's Events API\n   * The agent processes the request and streams responses back to the user\n2. **FastAPI Server (**`slack_ai_bot.py`):\n   * The central component handling HTTP requests from Slack\n   * Exposes endpoints for Slack events and mention events\n   * Manages rate limiting and concurrent request processing\n   * Orchestrates the entire flow from request to response\n3. **Content Analysis System**:\n   * Uses OpenAI to analyze the user's query through the `analyze_content` function\n   * Classifies queries as simple prompts or tool-requiring prompts\n   * Determines which specific tools (data sources) are needed:\n     * Slack history retrieval\n     * Linear issue search\n     * URL content extraction\n   * Optimizes search parameters for each data source\n4. **Tool Selection & Orchestration**:\n   * Based on content analysis, selects and coordinates appropriate tools\n   * Manages parallel data retrieval from multiple sources\n   * Combines results into a unified context for response generation\n5. **Linear RAG System**:\n   * **Components**:\n     * `linear_client.py`: Custom API client for Linear project management\n     * `linear_rag_search.py`: Semantic search implementation\n     * `linear_db.py`: Database interface layer\n     * `linear_rag_embeddings.py`: Vector embedding generation\n     * `linear_rag_db_import.py`: Data import pipeline\n   * **Functionality**:\n     * Maintains up-to-date issue data from Linear\n     * Generates and stores vector embeddings for semantic search\n     * Supports complex analytical queries and natural language searches\n     * Performs specialized analyses like status reports and workload distribution\n6. **PostgreSQL with pgvector**:\n   * Stores Linear issue data in structured tables\n   * Maintains vector embeddings for semantic similarity search\n   * Enables efficient hybrid search (semantic + metadata filtering)\n   * Supports complex SQL queries for analytical functions\n7. **Response Generation**:\n   * Uses retrieved context to generate a draft response\n   * Refines and formats the response for Slack's markdown format\n   * Streams the response to the user in real-time for better UX\n\n### Data Flow\n\n1. **Request Initiation**:\n   * User mentions the agent with a question in Slack\n   * Slack sends the mention event to the `/slack/events` endpoint\n   * Server acknowledges receipt and begins asynchronous processing\n2. **Content Analysis**:\n   * Agent uses OpenAI to analyze the user's question\n   * Determines if the query is a simple question or requires tool use\n   * Identifies which specific tools are needed for this query\n   * Example classification results:\n\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"content_type\": \"prompt_requires_tool_use\",\n       \"requires_slack_channel_history\": false,\n       \"perform_RAG_on_linear_issues\": true,\n       \"urls\": [\"https://github.com/org/repo\"]\n     }\n     ```\n3. **Data Retrieval**:\n   * For Slack history: Searches channel messages with AI-optimized parameters\n   * For Linear issues: Performs RAG-based search using vector embeddings\n   * For URLs: Extracts content from GitHub, Twitter, or general websites\n   * Each data source formats results for unified context building\n4. **Linear RAG Process** (when required):\n   * **Query Optimization**: AI analyzes the query to determine optimal search parameters:\n\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"query_type\": \"status_report\",\n       \"filters\": [\n         {\"field\": \"team->key\", \"operator\": \"=\", \"value\": \"ENG\"},\n         {\"field\": \"assignee->name\", \"operator\": \"=\", \"value\": \"Sam\"}\n       ],\n       \"time_range\": {\"field\": \"updatedAt\", \"operator\": \">\", \"value\": \"7d\"}\n     }\n     ```\n   * **Vector Search**: Converts query to embedding and finds similar issues in pgvector\n   * **Hybrid Filtering**: Applies metadata filters from parameters\n   * **Result Processing**: Formats and summarizes results for inclusion in context\n5. **Response Generation**:\n   * Combines retrieved context into a unified format\n   * Generates draft response with OpenAI using the context\n   * Refines the response for clarity and Slack formatting\n   * Streams the final response to the user in real-time\n6. **Conversation Maintenance**:\n   * Stores the interaction in conversation history\n   * Preserves thread context for follow-up questions\n   * Manages history expiration for resource efficiency"

            "body": "Here are some examples to save your time:\n\n**Token Metrics \u2013 Senior Product Manager Hiring Assessment**\n\n**Instructions:** Below are ten questions designed to evaluate strategic and technical product thinking for a senior Product Manager role at Token Metrics. The questions cover product discovery & delivery, crypto product models, cross-functional collaboration, tool usage, data-driven decision-making, agile processes, and knowledge of Token Metrics\u2019 core products (TMAI Agents, DAO governance, Trading AI APIs, Mobile App, Launchpad). Each question is followed by a rubric outlining expectations for Poor, Fair, Good, and Excellent responses. Use the rubric to understand the depth and quality of answer expected.\n\n**Question 1: Product Discovery for an AI Agent Feature**\n\nImagine you are tasked with conceptualizing a new AI trading assistant (a **TMAI Agent**) to help Token Metrics users make better investment decisions. Describe how you would approach the **product discovery** phase for this feature. What steps would you take to understand user needs and market opportunities, and how would you involve cross-functional teams (design, engineering, compliance, marketing) during discovery? Additionally, mention any tools (e.g. analytics or prototyping) you would use to validate ideas before moving to development.\n\n**Rubric:**\n\n\u2022 **Poor:** Jumps straight into building features without research or validation. Does not involve other teams in discovery. No mention of user research, data analysis, or prototyping (e.g. immediately describing solution details without evidence). Lacks understanding of what **TMAI Agents** are or how they provide value.\n\n\u2022 **Fair:** Acknowledges the need for some research or brainstorming but remains vague on methods. May mention talking to a couple of users or looking at competitors, but with little structure. Limited cross-functional input (e.g. consults design *or* engineering, but not others). Little or no use of tools like analytics or **Figma** \u2013 for example, might suggest a prototype but not clearly.\n\n\u2022 **Good:** Outlines a clear discovery process: for instance, conducting user interviews or surveys to identify user pain points and expectations for an AI trading assistant, analyzing usage data from **PostHog** (e.g. what investment decisions users struggle with) to find opportunities, and reviewing competitor AI bots. Involves key stakeholders early \u2013 collaborates with design on quick **Figma prototypes or user journey flows**, consults engineering on feasibility (ensuring initial ideas are technically viable), and checks with compliance on any regulatory constraints (like advice limitations or disclosures for AI agents). Uses feedback tools like **Featurebase** to gather any existing relevant user requests. Iteratively tests ideas (e.g. a clickable prototype or alpha bot) with a few users for validation before full commitment.\n\n\u2022 **Excellent:** Presents a comprehensive, data-informed discovery approach. For example: segments users and creates personas for who would use the TMAI Agent (newbie investors vs. experienced traders), conducts in-depth user research (interviews, maybe moderated usability tests with a mock AI assistant) and synthesizes findings into clear problem statements. Uses multiple data sources \u2013 **PostHog analytics** to identify points in the user journey where an AI assistant could add value, **Featurebase feedback** to see if users have asked for AI help or what questions they ask most. Co-designs the concept with cross-functional input: runs a discovery workshop including design, engineering, marketing, and compliance to brainstorm solutions and surface constraints (e.g. compliance flags potential KYC or disclosure needs early). Quickly prototypes several ideas in **Figma** (or even a simple bot script) and tests these with a subset of users or internal team members, iterating on feedback. By the end of discovery, provides evidence (research insights, validated prototypes, metrics potential) that the chosen direction meets user needs and business goals, before moving to delivery.\n\n**Question 2: Agile Delivery and Development Handoff**\n\nOne of Token Metrics\u2019 core features needs to be delivered under a tight deadline (e.g. an enhancement to the **Trading Bot** module that users have been eagerly awaiting). As the Product Manager, how would you plan and execute the delivery of this feature in an **Agile environment**? Describe how you would manage the timeline, coordinate with engineering and design through development and QA, and ensure a smooth handoff from design to development. Include which tools or ceremonies you would use to keep the delivery on track and maintain quality.\n\n**Rubric:**\n\n\u2022 **Poor:** Provides an unstructured or unrealistic plan. May ignore Agile practices entirely (e.g. \u201cwork harder to meet the deadline\u201d without process), or skip important steps like QA. Does not reference any coordination with design/engineering beyond assigning tasks. No mention of using project tracking tools (like **Linear**) or team ceremonies. Handoff from design is unclear or nonexistent (e.g. just emailing specs with no discussion).\n\n\u2022 **Fair:** Shows basic awareness of timeline management and possibly mentions working in sprints or having meetings. Might reference a daily stand-up or checking in with developers, but lacks detail on specific Agile ceremonies (e.g. sprint planning, retrospectives) or tools. Coordinates somewhat with design (perhaps ensures final Figma designs are ready) but may not integrate design and development work tightly. Could mention tracking progress, but only in general terms (e.g. \u201cI\u2019ll monitor the work\u201d) rather than using a defined tool or method.\n\n\u2022 **Good:** Describes a clear Agile delivery approach. For example, breaks the work into user stories or tasks in **Linear** (or a similar backlog tool) and conducts a sprint planning meeting with engineering to scope what can be done by the deadline. Mentions holding **daily Scrum stand-ups** to track progress and remove blockers, and uses **Linear** or a Kanban board to monitor status. Ensures a proper design-to-dev handoff by having the UX designer walk through **Figma prototypes** or design files with the engineers before implementation, clarifying user flows and edge cases. Includes QA in the plan \u2013 e.g. allocates time for testing and uses **Jam.dev** or a similar tool for capturing and reporting any bugs found during development. Communicates with stakeholders (like announcing progress in weekly updates or adjusting scope if needed) to manage the tight timeline responsibly.\n\n\u2022 **Excellent:** Demonstrates rigorous and proactive delivery management. For instance: works with engineering to possibly **re-scope or phase the feature** to meet the deadline without sacrificing quality (identifying a MVP vs. enhancements that can come later). Uses Agile practices fluently: conducts sprint planning to commit to what the team can realistically achieve, daily stand-ups to ensure alignment, mid-sprint check-ins, and a sprint review/demo to show the feature to stakeholders as soon as it\u2019s done. Emphasizes collaboration \u2013 engineers and designers are in constant sync (possibly co-locating a designer with the dev team for quick clarifications, and using Figma\u2019s handoff features or Storybook for design specs). Might mention using **Linear** for real-time roadmap updates and **PostHog** for setting up analytics events ahead of launch. Has a plan for quality under time crunch: for example, schedules a brief internal UAT or uses **Jam.dev** to instantly capture any critical issues during development so they can be fixed quickly. Proactively communicates any risk to deadline and negotiates trade-offs with stakeholders (e.g. dropping low-impact scope or securing extra dev help) rather than simply pushing the team blindly. Ensures by launch day that documentation is updated and support is ready, reflecting a thorough end-to-end delivery process.",

It carefully crafts a tweet that reflects the agent's unique voice and style while conveying key information.\n3. **Image Generation**:\n   * The system creates a detailed prompt describing what image would best complement the tweet\n   * It generates multiple candidate images featuring the mascot (LUCKY or TMAI)\n   * Each image is evaluated for quality and relevance\n   * The best image is selected and stored for use\n4. **Publishing**: Finally, the system publishes the tweet along with the generated image to the Twitter/X platform, completing the daily news update.\n\nThis process runs automatically to keep followers informed about cryptocurrency developments with a consistent and engaging style.\n\n### Tweet Engagement Process\n\nThe community engagement workflow operates as follows:\n\n1. **Target Account Monitoring**: The system monitors a curated list of influential crypto accounts for their recent tweets.\n2. **Tweet Collection & Filtering**:\n   * Retrieves recent tweets from these accounts\n   * Filters out tweets in foreign languages, quote tweets, and previously processed tweets\n   * Organizes tweets into batches for efficient processing\n   * Tracks which tweets have been seen or replied to using a date-based memory system\n3. **Tweet Analysis**:\n   * Separates tweets with and without images\n   * For tweets with images, analyzes the image content to understand context\n   * Evaluates the engagement potential of each tweet\n   * Categorizes tweets as either \"crypto\" or \"meme\" content for specialized responses\n4. **Reply Generation**:\n   * Creates tailored replies for each category of tweet\n   * Ensures replies match the agent's personality and brand voice\n   * Generates different styles of responses for crypto analysis vs. meme content\n   * Incorporates contextual understanding of both text and image content\n5. **Image Generation for Replies**:\n   * Creates custom images for each reply\n   * Uses both the original tweet and the generated reply as context\n   * Processes multiple image generation tasks in parallel for efficiency\n   * Selects the highest quality image for each reply\n6. **Response Deployment & Memory Management**:\n   * Posts the replies with their associated images\n   * Updates the memory system to track which tweets have been replied to\n   * Ensures the same tweet isn't processed multiple times\n   * Maintains a single engagement per author within each run\n\nBoth processes leverage advanced AI capabilities to create authentic, engaging content that provides value to the crypto community while maintaining a consistent brand presence.\n\n## Additional Features\n\n* **Date-based Memory System**: Tracks engagement history by date, creating new memory files each day while carrying over essential information\n* **Batched Processing**: Handles tweets in batches of 10 for efficient processing\n* **Author-based Engagement Limits**: Processes only one tweet per unique author in each run\n* **Parallel Image Generation**: Uses thread pooling to generate multiple images simultaneously\n* **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management to ensure process resilience\n\n---\n\nTL;DR\n\nLUCKY Agent can now posts and comments to engage.\n\n@ian @manav @talha ",

Meanwhile, we\u2019re rolling out similar functionality in our Trading Agents, which we aim to launch soon.\n\nFor V2, from our conversation, we wanted to offer direct buy/sell features aligned with bull and bear signals on the Token Details page. We believe the simplest way is to link users to the Trading Agent for automated trades. We\u2019re already working on custom time frames (e.g., a specified holding period).\n\nFrom what I understood, a big part of your requirement is for us to add user-defined preferences (e.g., \u201cbuy now and sell on the next bearish signal\u201d). We can add this into the Trading Agents.\n\nLet me know if this approach meets your expectations or if you have any questions.",

Other regime filters (personal ideas, to be tested if above don't perform well) : \n   1. ~~breakout rule in btc~~ -> doesn't work\n   2. breakout rule in individual tokens\n   3. ~~btc's sma50~~ -> doesn't work\n   4. [Equity Curve Trading \u2013 Build Alpha](https://www.buildalpha.com/equity-curve-trading/)\n\nOther ideas (future research) :\n\n* ROC-based rotation with BTC regime filter :[ https://en.rattibha.com/thread/1817918738554847388](https://en.rattibha.com/thread/1817918738554847388) \n* TrendCatcher by Robuxio : [TrendCatcher](https://www.robuxio.com/wp-content/uploads/TrendCatcher.pdf)\n* Conor's RSI2 : [1/ Larry Connor\u2019s 2-period RSI strategy on crypto.

If StarRocks becomes unresponsive, connections may remain open indefinitely, leading to resource exhaustion and potential pipeline failures.\n\n**Task:**\n\n* Implement a timeout mechanism in the DAG to automatically close stuck connections.\n* Ensure the timeout is configurable and reasonable for live price updates.\n* Add logging and alerts to track occurrences of timeouts.\n* Test the solution to confirm it prevents prolonged connection hangs without disrupting normal operations.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n* The DAG gracefully handles StarRocks timeouts without leaving hanging connections.\n* Configurable timeout settings allow tuning based on workload needs.\n* Proper logging and alerting are in place for debugging and monitoring."

Additionally, the `COINGECKO_TOKENS_LIVE_PRICE` table is non-partitioned, so deleting parent partitions would remove all data within the table. Unfortunately, this means our only option is to re-migrate the table from Snowflake.\n\nThis situation also highlights an important risk: in future failures, we won\u2019t have fallback data from Snowflake. Therefore, we need a reliable strategy for risk management. In my view, we must ensure that data is stored externally, so that if a table becomes corrupted or unusable for any reason, we can quickly recover and backfill it.\n\nTo address this, I\u2019m implementing two actions:\n\n1. All data must be stored in GCS **before** being written to StarRocks.\n2. A daily backup process will run, storing data and cleaning up any previous temp data.\n\nThis ensures that even if issues arise with StarRocks, we have a reliable backup to restore and recover from.\n\ncc @andrew @vasilis ",

The preferred style of writing \n2. The engagement time (when do users interact with the post type?)\n3. The preferred post type (most important - which posts are of higher interest? maybe we can schedule them to run more frequently?)"

If so, how could I specify the max size to be in value?\n\r\nHim : size_type is applied to all size arguments, there's no way of specifying size_type just for max_size. In from_signals you could set size dynamically by converting your size and max_size to amount first, but from_orders doesn't support callbacks (https://vectorbt.pro/pvt_7a467f6b/documentation/portfolio/from-signals/)\r\n\nMe : Not sure whether from_signals will suffice for what I need to achieve, as I cannot configure the sizes in amount prior simulation (as the amount is path-dependent). I'll use ChatVBT to figure it out and revert here if needed. On that, I am trying to set it up yet it's still loading (see attached). Is this normal?\r\n\r\n\\*\\* Fyi, this will be my prompt : \r\n\r\nI have a dataframe of close prices and a dataframe of target weights, represented in percent (eg. 0.25 is 25%). How can I simulate a portfolio that starts with 10k and allocates respective to these weights? Keep in mind that the weight (a) is either positive or zero (no allocation), and (b) can change during a position, thus require rebalancing (eg. it can be 0.25 at the start of the position, but it can change to 0.18 later, thus requiring the position to decrease). Apart from those, how can I enforce the positions to not exceed 10k in value?\r\n\r\nHim : You don't need to configure the sizes prior to the simulation, from_signals allows you to set sizes dynamically where you can decide, at each timestamp, which size to order\r\n\nHim : I recommend going to the documentation on from_signals that I linked previously. You can convert your target percent to amount using amount = vbt.pf_nb.get_order_size_nb(c, size_in_percent, size_type=vbt.pf_enums.SizeType.TargetPercent) \r\n",

This enhancement ensures that trading strategies adhere to predefined size constraints, promoting consistent and controlled execution.\n\n**Business Rationale:**\nAccurate position sizing is essential for effective risk management and strategy performance. By addressing the Max Size logic, we can prevent over-allocation of resources, minimize potential losses, and increase the reliability of automated trading strategies built with VectorBT.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n* The `from_signals` method correctly enforces the maximum position size as defined.\n* Existing trading strategies operate without exceeding the specified size limits.\n* All related unit tests pass, and new tests are added to validate the Max Size functionality.\n* Documentation is updated to reflect the changes in position sizing logic."

        "description": "Create real-time grades based on the orderbook data we get from BitQuery. Various grading formulas should be implemented and evaluated, with features including: \n\n1. Net Volume \n\n```\nDefined as : Sum of buy volume - Sum of sell volume\n\nThe net volume can be used as simply as :\n\n- Net Volume > 0 \u2192 More buying pressure (bullish)\n- Net Volume < 0 \u2192 More selling pressure (bearish)\n\nThen to formulate a grade, we simply compare the net volume across different tokens\n```\n\n2. VWAP (Volume-weighted average price)\n\n```\nDefined as : sum(price x amount) / sum(amount)\n\nInterpretation:\n- If the current price is above VWAP, the market is strong (buyers in control).\n- If the current price is below VWAP, the market is weak (sellers in control).\n\nThen to formulate a grade, we simply compute the difference between the \nprice and the VWAP. The more positive it is, the better the grade.\n```\n\n3. Maker Activity\n\n```\nDefined as : total makers buying / total makers\n\nIntepretation:\n- If makers are mostly buying, it suggests passive accumulation.\n- If makers are mostly selling, it suggests distribution.\n\nThen to formulate a grade, we rank the tokens by the maker activity. \nThe higher it is, the better the grade.\n```\n\n4. Market Pressure (Buy/Sell Ratio)\n\n```\nDefined as : sum(buy amount) / sum(sell amount)\n\nInterpretation:\n- Ratio > 1 \u2192 More buyers than sellers (bullish).\n- Ratio < 1 \u2192 More sellers than buyers (bearish).\n\nThen to formulate a grade, we rank the tokens by the market pressure ratio. \nThe higher it is, the better the grade.\n```\n\nAll of the abovementioned metrics will fluctuate differently, for different time intervals. My opinion is that we should see the derived performance of each, and all of them combined (possibly in a weighted way), across the following time intervals:\n\n```\nShort-term : 1-min, 5-min, 15-min (applicable for HFT)\n\nMedium-term : Hourly, 4-hour (applicable for intraday trading, potentially useful for the Trading Agents)\n\nLong-term : Daily, Weekly (potentially useful for Investor Grades)\n```\n\nWe can take this a step further to create a composite grade that consists of the `average grade across all time intervals`. This can enhance the grade quality as it incorporates all intervals, essentially depicting the token's quality across all timeframes. My view though is that we should have separate grades. Further insights will be added in this ticket as the implementation gets processed.",

      "full_context": "Title: Create Real Time Grades\n\nDescription:\nCreate real-time grades based on the orderbook data we get from BitQuery. Various grading formulas should be implemented and evaluated, with features including: \n\n1. Net Volume \n\n```\nDefined as : Sum of buy volume - Sum of sell volume\n\nThe net volume can be used as simply as :\n\n- Net Volume > 0 \u2192 More buying pressure (bullish)\n- Net Volume < 0 \u2192 More selling pressure (bearish)\n\nThen to formulate a grade, we simply compare the net volume across different tokens\n```\n\n2. VWAP (Volume-weighted average price)\n\n```\nDefined as : sum(price x amount) / sum(amount)\n\nInterpretation:\n- If the current price is above VWAP, the market is strong (buyers in control).\n- If the current price is below VWAP, the market is weak (sellers in control).\n\nThen to formulate a grade, we simply compute the difference between the \nprice and the VWAP. The more positive it is, the better the grade.\n```\n\n3. Maker Activity\n\n```\nDefined as : total makers buying / total makers\n\nIntepretation:\n- If makers are mostly buying, it suggests passive accumulation.\n- If makers are mostly selling, it suggests distribution.\n\nThen to formulate a grade, we rank the tokens by the maker activity. \nThe higher it is, the better the grade.\n```\n\n4. Market Pressure (Buy/Sell Ratio)\n\n```\nDefined as : sum(buy amount) / sum(sell amount)\n\nInterpretation:\n- Ratio > 1 \u2192 More buyers than sellers (bullish).\n- Ratio < 1 \u2192 More sellers than buyers (bearish).\n\nThen to formulate a grade, we rank the tokens by the market pressure ratio. \nThe higher it is, the better the grade.\n```\n\nAll of the abovementioned metrics will fluctuate differently, for different time intervals. My opinion is that we should see the derived performance of each, and all of them combined (possibly in a weighted way), across the following time intervals:\n\n```\nShort-term : 1-min, 5-min, 15-min (applicable for HFT)\n\nMedium-term : Hourly, 4-hour (applicable for intraday trading, potentially useful for the Trading Agents)\n\nLong-term : Daily, Weekly (potentially useful for Investor Grades)\n```\n\nWe can take this a step further to create a composite grade that consists of the `average grade across all time intervals`. This can enhance the grade quality as it incorporates all intervals, essentially depicting the token's quality across all timeframes. My view though is that we should have separate grades. Further insights will be added in this ticket as the implementation gets processed."

This issue causes the user interface to be cut off and affects the overall user experience, as users cannot see or interact with the full content.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/7973c9b8-96e2-4bd0-a0c7-d1dd7f5f8e44](https://jam.dev/c/7973c9b8-96e2-4bd0-a0c7-d1dd7f5f8e44)\n\n## **Title5:** \"Connect Wallet\" Button Not Working in \"Buy Index\" Popup\n\n**Description:**\nThe **\"Connect Wallet\"** button in the **\"Buy Index\"** popup is not functioning as expected. When clicked, nothing happens, and the wallet is not connected, preventing users from completing the **Buy Index** process. This issue disrupts the user's ability to interact with the platform properly.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/f2c5ba2b-72d1-4851-a00d-7c6e10fcbbb7](https://jam.dev/c/f2c5ba2b-72d1-4851-a00d-7c6e10fcbbb7)\n\n## **Title6:** Missing Token  Price Field in \"Invest\" Section of \"Buy Index\" Popup\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **\"Buy Index\"** popup, the **\"Invest\"** section is missing the field that should display the corresponding **dollar price** for the selected token. This field is essential for users to see the price of the token in dollars before proceeding with the transaction.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/941c8bf0-5fcc-452b-8f75-9c37530adce3](https://jam.dev/c/941c8bf0-5fcc-452b-8f75-9c37530adce3)\n\n## **Title7:** \"Buy Index\" Text Should Be Specific to the Index (e.g., \"Buy Meme Index\")\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **\"Buy Index\"** section, the text currently reads as **\"Buy Index\"**, but it should dynamically display the specific name of the index . For example, when a user is on the **Meme Index** page, the text should **\"Buy Meme Index\"** as shown in the **Figma design**.

This migration aims to enhance code maintainability, improve type safety, and optimize database interactions.\n\n**Business Rationale:** Addressing this technical debt will streamline development processes, reduce potential bugs, and improve application performance. Leveraging Prisma's features will facilitate faster feature implementation and ensure a more robust platform for users engaging in governance and staking activities.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. The \"Fetch Proposal Details\" query is fully migrated to Prisma without loss of functionality.\n2. All related unit and integration tests pass successfully.\n3. Performance benchmarks post-migration meet or exceed current standards.\n4. Code review is completed and approved by the technical team.\n5. Documentation is updated to reflect the changes in the query implementation."

This will eliminate the need for users to navigate to the Axelar site to manually pay gas fees. Additionally, ensure that all transactions and their live tracking are accessible within the TokenMetrics dashboard.\n\n**Business Rationale:**  \nStreamlining the gas fee payment process within TokenMetrics enhances the overall user experience, reducing friction and dependency on external platforms. This improvement is expected to increase user satisfaction, retention, and engagement by providing a seamless and efficient transaction workflow.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. Users can pay gas fees directly on the TokenMetrics website without being redirected to the Axelar site.\n2. All transactions initiated through TokenMetrics are tracked and displayed in real-time on the dashboard.\n3. The integration maintains or improves the website\u2019s performance and reliability.\n4.

This guarantees consistent pod management and reliable handling of persistent storage.\n\n**Business Rationale:** Managing Pods through StatefulSets provides stable identities and persistent storage, which enhances application reliability and simplifies production readiness on Digital Ocean. This enforcement reduces potential downtime and streamlines maintenance processes.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n* All Pods utilizing DOBS volumes are verified to be owned by a StatefulSet.\n* Any Pods not currently managed by a StatefulSet are reconfigured accordingly.\n* Successful completion of production readiness checks on Digital Ocean without volume ownership issues."

This will allow selective test execution for different modules based on the need.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**:\n\n1. **Test Selection**:\n   * The user should be able to select a specific Cypress test module (e.g., login, ratings page, market page) to run from GitHub.\n   * The selection of test modules will be done using the GitHub Actions workflow, where a specific spec file is chosen for execution.\n2. **GitHub Actions Configuration**:\n   * The Cypress tests should be organized into spec files based on different modules (e.g., `login.spec.js`, `ratings-page.spec.js`, `market-page.spec.js`).\n   * A GitHub Actions workflow should be configured to trigger Cypress tests based on the selected spec.\n   * The workflow should allow manual selection of the test module to be run using the `workflow_dispatch` feature in GitHub Actions.\n3. **Manual Trigger**:\n   * The user can manually trigger the workflow from GitHub and specify the module they want to test.\n   * The available options for selection (e.g., `login.spec.js`, `ratings-page.spec.js`, `market-page.spec.js`) should be passed as input when triggering the workflow.\n4. **Environment Configuration**:\n   * Ensure that the `CYPRESS_SPEC` environment variable is used in the GitHub Actions workflow to specify the test module (spec file) to be executed.\n   * The test execution should only run the selected spec file, not the entire suite of tests.\n5. **Expected Outcome**:\n   * When the user selects a specific test module (e.g., login), only the corresponding tests for that module should run.\n   * The output of the test run should display results for the selected module, and the workflow should complete successfully."

However, we encountered numerous challenges related to dependencies and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), which complicated the deployment process. After a discussion, the DevOps team decided to transition from FluxCD to ArgoCD to unify our Kubernetes deployment process. We have successfully migrated several applications, including their secrets and configmaps, to the new system. Currently, we are addressing issues such as deployments requiring additional memory in volumes, leading to quota limits, and constraints on node (VM) sizes due to similar quota restrictions in DigitalOcean (and we may need to reach out to them and request an increase in these @ian). Despite these challenges, we have successfully deployed four out of the five major workloads in the data team\u2019s repository; we will need to sync with @jake to test out and finalize.

This page will display all V1 Trading AI Agents integrated with Privy and Fiat gateways, allowing users to view and manage their trading agents efficiently.\n\n**Business Rationale:**\nEnhancing the Agent Listing Page with the V2 design will improve user experience by providing a more intuitive and streamlined interface. Integrating Privy and Fiat gateways supports broader payment options, catering to a wider user base and increasing platform usability and adoption.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. **Design Implementation:** The Agent Listing Page matches the provided Figma design in layout, styling, and responsiveness across major browsers and devices.\n2. **Agent Display:** All V1 Trading AI Agents with Privy and Fiat gateways are listed with accurate details, including agent name, status, and gateway type.\n3. **Interactivity:** Users can perform essential actions such as viewing agent details, editing settings, and deleting agents directly from the list view.\n4. **Performance:** The page loads within acceptable timeframes and handles data efficiently without lag.\n5. **Accessibility:** The page adheres to accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1), ensuring it is usable by all users.\n6. **Testing:** Comprehensive front-end tests are written and pass, covering key functionalities and UI components."

To address this, we are working to adapt these tables to meet Prisma's requirements so the team can start coding as soon as possible.\n\nThis process involves more manual effort than simply copying data from Snowflake to Supabase.

        "description": "**High-Level Objective:**\nMigrate our OLTP workloads from Snowflake to Supabase Postgres using Prisma ORM, while keeping Snowflake dedicated to OLAP. By separating transactional and analytical queries, we aim to reduce latency, improve scalability, enhance developer velocity, and set the stage for future architectural improvements. This serves as an intermediary step before considering potential long-term migrations to ClickHouse or StarRocks.\n\n**Context & Business Value:**\nToken Metrics currently relies on Snowflake for both OLTP and OLAP, causing latency and performance bottlenecks for user-facing queries. Moving OLTP to Supabase Postgres and integrating Prisma will deliver faster response times for critical, real-time data queries. Users benefit from quicker insights, improving their trading decisions and overall satisfaction. Faster queries also differentiate Token Metrics from competitors and reduce costs over time.\n\n**Key Points & Clarifications:**\n\n* We already have a Supabase account and can create or use a dedicated project/database for OLTP workloads.\n* Prisma needs a target database to manage the schema, so we will set up Prisma with Supabase first, then migrate data from Snowflake into the newly prepared schema.\n* Cursor AI should be used as a first resort for each step. If Cursor AI can\u2019t complete a task, give it feedback and try again. Only if it still fails should we proceed manually.\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n* Cursor AI first approach at every step.\n* Redis caching, PgBouncer, and edge deployments are optional optimizations depending on complexity and time.\n* This interim state improves performance before any potential future migration to ClickHouse or StarRocks.\n\n**Success Criteria for Overall Project:**\n\n* OLTP fully migrated and served by Supabase + Prisma.\n* Snowflake reserved for OLAP without latency impacting user-facing queries.\n* Verified performance improvements (reduced latency, stable load performance).\n* Clear path established for scaling to 10+ million users.",

By separating transactional and analytical queries, we aim to reduce latency, improve scalability, enhance developer velocity, and set the stage for future architectural improvements. This serves as an intermediary step before considering potential long-term migrations to ClickHouse or StarRocks.\n\n**Context & Business Value:**\nToken Metrics currently relies on Snowflake for both OLTP and OLAP, causing latency and performance bottlenecks for user-facing queries. Moving OLTP to Supabase Postgres and integrating Prisma will deliver faster response times for critical, real-time data queries. Users benefit from quicker insights, improving their trading decisions and overall satisfaction. Faster queries also differentiate Token Metrics from competitors and reduce costs over time.\n\n**Key Points & Clarifications:**\n\n* We already have a Supabase account and can create or use a dedicated project/database for OLTP workloads.\n* Prisma needs a target database to manage the schema, so we will set up Prisma with Supabase first, then migrate data from Snowflake into the newly prepared schema.\n* Cursor AI should be used as a first resort for each step. If Cursor AI can\u2019t complete a task, give it feedback and try again. Only if it still fails should we proceed manually.\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n* Cursor AI first approach at every step.\n* Redis caching, PgBouncer, and edge deployments are optional optimizations depending on complexity and time.\n* This interim state improves performance before any potential future migration to ClickHouse or StarRocks.\n\n**Success Criteria for Overall Project:**\n\n* OLTP fully migrated and served by Supabase + Prisma.\n* Snowflake reserved for OLAP without latency impacting user-facing queries.\n* Verified performance improvements (reduced latency, stable load performance).\n* Clear path established for scaling to 10+ million users."

This issue aims to address these bottlenecks by outlining actionable tasks for the development team.\n\nCurrent Performance Metrics:\n\n```\n\u2022\tTime to First Byte (TTFB): 1.5s (Goal: < 600ms)\n\n\u2022\tFirst Contentful Paint (FCP): 9.3s (Goal: < 2.5s)\n\n\u2022\tLargest Contentful Paint (LCP): 9.6s (Goal: < 2.5s)\n\n\u2022\tTotal Blocking Time (TBT): 1,470ms (Goal: < 300ms)\n```\n\nStart first optimizing the highest opportunity pages according to Sentry below.\n\n[https://tokenmetrics-30.sentry.io/performance/?environment=production&statsPeriod=90d](https://tokenmetrics-30.sentry.io/performance/?environment=production&statsPeriod=90d)\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/06c792c0-a832-4358-9499-01fc15814ad0/7d9f0df5-07a8-440a-bb60-a7a560ebd961)\n\nAcceptance Criteria\n\n```\n\u2022\tPerformance Goals Met:\n\n\u2022\tTTFB is under 600ms.\n\n\u2022\tFCP and LCP are under 2.5s.\n\n\u2022\tTBT is under 300ms.\n\n\u2022\tFunctionality Unaffected:\n\n\u2022\tAll existing features work as before.\n\n\u2022\tNo new bugs or regressions introduced.\n\n\u2022\tCode Quality Maintained:\n\n\u2022\tAll changes are reviewed and approved.\n\n\u2022\tCode adheres to existing style guidelines.\n\n\u2022\tTesting Completed:\n\n\u2022\tAll unit and integration tests pass.\n\n\u2022\tNew tests added for any new functionality.\n\n\u2022\tMonitoring in Place:\n\n\u2022\tPerformance monitoring tools are active.\n\n\u2022\tAlerts configured for performance regressions.\n```\n\n## 1\\. Optimize large pages\n\n1. Use the Next.js bundle analyzer to identify the largest components in `/[locale]/trading-bot/highest-rated`, `/[locale]/settings`, and `/[locale]/old/[...token]`.\n2. For each identified large component:\n\n   a. Implement dynamic imports using `next/dynamic`.\n\n   b. Add loading states or skeletons for dynamically imported components.\n3. Use the `priority` prop on `next/image` for above-the-fold images.\n4. Implement virtualization for long lists using `react-window` or `react-virtualized`.\n5. Run the bundle analyzer again and compare sizes. Aim for at least a 20% reduction.\n\n## 2\\. Reduce shared bundle size\n\n1. Run `npm ls` to list all dependencies and their sizes.\n2. Identify large or redundant packages.\n3. Use a tool like `depcheck` to find unused dependencies.\n4. Remove or replace large packages with lighter alternatives where possible.\n5. Audit import statements across the project, replacing default imports with named imports where applicable.\n6. Implement code splitting for large third-party libraries using dynamic imports.\n7. Compare the new shared bundle size with the original. Target a 15-25% reduction.\n\n## 3\\. Analyze and optimize third-party libraries\n\n1. Review the usage of '@stablelib/random' and identify why it's causing import issues.\n2. If '@stablelib/random' is necessary, fix the import by using named imports instead of default import.\n3. If it's not critical, find a lighter alternative or implement the functionality natively.\n4. Use the `import cost` VS Code extension to identify other large imports.\n5. For each large third-party library:\n\n   a. Evaluate if it's necessary or if it can be replaced with a lighter alternative.\n\n   b. If kept, ensure only necessary parts are imported.\n\n   c. Consider lazy loading the library if it's not needed immediately.\n6. Document changes made and their impact on bundle size.",

      "full_context": "Title: Frontend Optimization\n\nDescription:\nToken Metrics is experiencing performance issues, as indicated by recent PageSpeed Insights reports. \n\nKey performance metrics such as Time to First Byte (TTFB), First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), and Total Blocking Time (TBT) are below optimal thresholds. This issue aims to address these bottlenecks by outlining actionable tasks for the development team.\n\nCurrent Performance Metrics:\n\n```\n\u2022\tTime to First Byte (TTFB): 1.5s (Goal: < 600ms)\n\n\u2022\tFirst Contentful Paint (FCP): 9.3s (Goal: < 2.5s)\n\n\u2022\tLargest Contentful Paint (LCP): 9.6s (Goal: < 2.5s)\n\n\u2022\tTotal Blocking Time (TBT): 1,470ms (Goal: < 300ms)\n```\n\nStart first optimizing the highest opportunity pages according to Sentry below.\n\n[https://tokenmetrics-30.sentry.io/performance/?environment=production&statsPeriod=90d](https://tokenmetrics-30.sentry.io/performance/?environment=production&statsPeriod=90d)\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/06c792c0-a832-4358-9499-01fc15814ad0/7d9f0df5-07a8-440a-bb60-a7a560ebd961)\n\nAcceptance Criteria\n\n```\n\u2022\tPerformance Goals Met:\n\n\u2022\tTTFB is under 600ms.\n\n\u2022\tFCP and LCP are under 2.5s.\n\n\u2022\tTBT is under 300ms.\n\n\u2022\tFunctionality Unaffected:\n\n\u2022\tAll existing features work as before.\n\n\u2022\tNo new bugs or regressions introduced.\n\n\u2022\tCode Quality Maintained:\n\n\u2022\tAll changes are reviewed and approved.\n\n\u2022\tCode adheres to existing style guidelines.\n\n\u2022\tTesting Completed:\n\n\u2022\tAll unit and integration tests pass.\n\n\u2022\tNew tests added for any new functionality.\n\n\u2022\tMonitoring in Place:\n\n\u2022\tPerformance monitoring tools are active.\n\n\u2022\tAlerts configured for performance regressions.\n```\n\n## 1\\. Optimize large pages\n\n1. Use the Next.js bundle analyzer to identify the largest components in `/[locale]/trading-bot/highest-rated`, `/[locale]/settings`, and `/[locale]/old/[...token]`.\n2. For each identified large component:\n\n   a. Implement dynamic imports using `next/dynamic`.\n\n   b. Add loading states or skeletons for dynamically imported components.\n3. Use the `priority` prop on `next/image` for above-the-fold images.\n4. Implement virtualization for long lists using `react-window` or `react-virtualized`.\n5. Run the bundle analyzer again and compare sizes. Aim for at least a 20% reduction.\n\n## 2\\. Reduce shared bundle size\n\n1. Run `npm ls` to list all dependencies and their sizes.\n2. Identify large or redundant packages.\n3. Use a tool like `depcheck` to find unused dependencies.\n4. Remove or replace large packages with lighter alternatives where possible.\n5. Audit import statements across the project, replacing default imports with named imports where applicable.\n6. Implement code splitting for large third-party libraries using dynamic imports.\n7. Compare the new shared bundle size with the original. Target a 15-25% reduction.\n\n## 3\\. Analyze and optimize third-party libraries\n\n1. Review the usage of '@stablelib/random' and identify why it's causing import issues.\n2. If '@stablelib/random' is necessary, fix the import by using named imports instead of default import.\n3. If it's not critical, find a lighter alternative or implement the functionality natively.\n4. Use the `import cost` VS Code extension to identify other large imports.\n5. For each large third-party library:\n\n   a. Evaluate if it's necessary or if it can be replaced with a lighter alternative.\n\n   b. If kept, ensure only necessary parts are imported.\n\n   c. Consider lazy loading the library if it's not needed immediately.\n6. Document changes made and their impact on bundle size."
