        "description": "Manifest - 63.33%\n\nScorecard: [Manifest - FR Scoresheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nB4U-lGCBW2ez2qXzS4b4MISoD5Ht9iPbOxZGIESSns/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## Introduction:\n\n* Manifest is a financial technology company that leverages blockchain technology to provide global investors with access to U.S. private equity real estate investments.\n* We've emerged from leading crypto accelerators Alliance and CV Labs.\n* Manifest operates under BVI and Cayman law and complies with relevant U.S. securities laws and financial regulations.\n* Manifest brings institutional-grade U.S. real estate to investors worldwide through onchain ownership.\n\n## Solution:\n\n* By tokenizing real estate assets, Manifest facilitates scalable and liquid investments, offering exposure to U.S. home price appreciation without the burdens of direct property ownership.\n* The return profile of HEIs stems from their unique structure.\n* When Manifest makes an HEI investment, it receives 2x economic rights relative to its investment amount. This is called the \u201cEquity Multiple.\u201d\n* For example, if Manifest invests $100,000 in a $1,000,000 home, it receives a 20% economic interest in the home's value (double the 10% that the investment represents of the home's value).\n* This creates an immediate \"paper gain\" that translates into actual returns when the property is eventually sold, refinanced, or reaches the end of the HEI term.\n\n## Innovation:\n\n* Our first product is called $USH, an ERC-20 token that targets stable \\~13% annual returns from American residential real estate equity.\n* For the first time, American real estate can be used in a programmatic capacity onchain, similar in utility to stablecoins, but with a significantly higher native yield.\n* Manifest harnesses blockchain technology so you can invest in a portfolio of diversified American real estate equity in under 30 seconds.\n* With dramatically lower fees, deep secondary liquidity, and tax efficiency, Manifest opens institutional-grade real estate to everyone, everywhere \u2014 while providing full transparency, seamless DeFi composability, and unmatched simplicity.\n\n## Use Case / Features:\n\n* Our first product, $USH, provides exposure to U.S. residential real estate through Home Equity Investments (called \u201cHEIs\u201d).\n* Home Equity Investments (called \u201cHEIs\u201d) are financial instruments that provide investment exposure to U.S. home price appreciation without the burden of ownership or property management.\n* Unlike traditional real estate investments that require active management and dealing with tenants, HEIs offer a streamlined approach to gaining exposure to the U.S. housing market.\n* Our protocol is designed to expand to other private market assets over time, always focusing on high-quality, institutional-grade investments with strong risk-adjusted returns.\n\n## Traction:\n\n* \n\n## Tokenomics:\n\n* $USH is a yield generating ERC-20 token backed by a portfolio of HEIs.\n* As the $USH Collateral Pool accumulates value, profits are reinvested in additional HEIs to grow the backing value per token and defer capital gains taxes.\n* Distributions are ultimately made to $USH tokenholders when the $USH tokenholders vote to redeem their tokens.\n* $USH is expected to increase in value approximately 13% annually. These returns accumulate in the token.\n* Asset valuations and portfolio performance are calculated daily and recorded onchain, providing full transparency to the assets backing $USH tokens.\n\nWhat are the main benefits of $USH?\n\n* \\~13% annual returns net\n* Institutional-grade exposure to U.S. residential housing with improved liquidity and efficiency\n* Access to off-market discounts of approximately 50% to fair-market home values\n* Global accessibility; investments are possible in under 30 seconds\n* A tax-efficient structure designed for perpetual tax deferral\n* DeFi composability allowing tokens to be used across protocols for additional yield\n* Real-time transparency with all assets recorded onchain\n* Voting- $USH holders can vote on whether to redeem all their tokens for the value of the collateral real estate. $USH holders, through this limited right, control the value of their investment because they are able to determine when they will collectively receive the value of the backing assets.\n\n* The first season of Manifest Points will commence in mid-2025.\n\n* $USA is Manifest's governance token that enables community participation in protocol decisions. Token holders can propose and vote on key protocol decisions, including whether to initiate fees, that shape the future of the Manifest ecosystem.\n* While $USH represents investment exposure to U.S. real estate assets, $USA is purely a governance token. $USH is backed by real-world assets and designed to appreciate with those assets, whereas $USA derives its value from the governance rights it confers over the Manifest protocol, protocol fee distributions, and its role in the broader ecosystem.\n* Beyond governance rights, $USA provides the opportunity to earn rewards in the form of $USA token buybacks or staking. Future utility may include additional staking opportunities, discounts, and other rewards.\n* $USA has a maximum supply cap of 100M tokens.\n\n## Roadmap:\n\n* \n\n## Business Model:\n\n* Manifest expects to be able to generate returns of 16.0-17.5% on a portfolio of HEIs after:\n  * Origination costs\n  * Losses from defaults.\n  * Costs from operations and servicing the portfolio of HEIs\n  * Cash drag from holding limited cash equivalents for working capital and liquidity (cash equivalent holdings expected to be \\~ 5% of TVL)\n* Manifest governance may decide to apply additional fees. In the event of these fees, Manifest expects annual fees of approximately 2.0-3.0%.\n\n## Go-To-Market:\n\n* \n\n## Investors:\n\n* $2.5M Pre-Seed in March 2025 from\n  * **VanEck - 3**\n  * **Lattice - 7**\n  * **Compound - 9**\n  * SALT\n\n## Community:\n\n* 1.4k on X\n* 159 on Telegram\u00a0\n* 255 on LinkedIn\n\n## Competition:\u00a0\n\n* \n\n## Team:\u00a0\n\n* Manifest was founded by Nathaniel Sokoll-Ward and Robert V.

This is called the \u201cEquity Multiple.\u201d\n* For example, if Manifest invests $100,000 in a $1,000,000 home, it receives a 20% economic interest in the home's value (double the 10% that the investment represents of the home's value).\n* This creates an immediate \"paper gain\" that translates into actual returns when the property is eventually sold, refinanced, or reaches the end of the HEI term.\n\n## Innovation:\n\n* Our first product is called $USH, an ERC-20 token that targets stable \\~13% annual returns from American residential real estate equity.\n* For the first time, American real estate can be used in a programmatic capacity onchain, similar in utility to stablecoins, but with a significantly higher native yield.\n* Manifest harnesses blockchain technology so you can invest in a portfolio of diversified American real estate equity in under 30 seconds.\n* With dramatically lower fees, deep secondary liquidity, and tax efficiency, Manifest opens institutional-grade real estate to everyone, everywhere \u2014 while providing full transparency, seamless DeFi composability, and unmatched simplicity.\n\n## Use Case / Features:\n\n* Our first product, $USH, provides exposure to U.S. residential real estate through Home Equity Investments (called \u201cHEIs\u201d).\n* Home Equity Investments (called \u201cHEIs\u201d) are financial instruments that provide investment exposure to U.S. home price appreciation without the burden of ownership or property management.\n* Unlike traditional real estate investments that require active management and dealing with tenants, HEIs offer a streamlined approach to gaining exposure to the U.S. housing market.\n* Our protocol is designed to expand to other private market assets over time, always focusing on high-quality, institutional-grade investments with strong risk-adjusted returns.\n\n## Traction:\n\n* \n\n## Tokenomics:\n\n* $USH is a yield generating ERC-20 token backed by a portfolio of HEIs.\n* As the $USH Collateral Pool accumulates value, profits are reinvested in additional HEIs to grow the backing value per token and defer capital gains taxes.\n* Distributions are ultimately made to $USH tokenholders when the $USH tokenholders vote to redeem their tokens.\n* $USH is expected to increase in value approximately 13% annually. These returns accumulate in the token.\n* Asset valuations and portfolio performance are calculated daily and recorded onchain, providing full transparency to the assets backing $USH tokens.\n\nWhat are the main benefits of $USH?\n\n* \\~13% annual returns net\n* Institutional-grade exposure to U.S. residential housing with improved liquidity and efficiency\n* Access to off-market discounts of approximately 50% to fair-market home values\n* Global accessibility; investments are possible in under 30 seconds\n* A tax-efficient structure designed for perpetual tax deferral\n* DeFi composability allowing tokens to be used across protocols for additional yield\n* Real-time transparency with all assets recorded onchain\n* Voting- $USH holders can vote on whether to redeem all their tokens for the value of the collateral real estate. $USH holders, through this limited right, control the value of their investment because they are able to determine when they will collectively receive the value of the backing assets.\n\n* The first season of Manifest Points will commence in mid-2025.\n\n* $USA is Manifest's governance token that enables community participation in protocol decisions. Token holders can propose and vote on key protocol decisions, including whether to initiate fees, that shape the future of the Manifest ecosystem.\n* While $USH represents investment exposure to U.S. real estate assets, $USA is purely a governance token. $USH is backed by real-world assets and designed to appreciate with those assets, whereas $USA derives its value from the governance rights it confers over the Manifest protocol, protocol fee distributions, and its role in the broader ecosystem.\n* Beyond governance rights, $USA provides the opportunity to earn rewards in the form of $USA token buybacks or staking. Future utility may include additional staking opportunities, discounts, and other rewards.\n* $USA has a maximum supply cap of 100M tokens.\n\n## Roadmap:\n\n* \n\n## Business Model:\n\n* Manifest expects to be able to generate returns of 16.0-17.5% on a portfolio of HEIs after:\n  * Origination costs\n  * Losses from defaults.\n  * Costs from operations and servicing the portfolio of HEIs\n  * Cash drag from holding limited cash equivalents for working capital and liquidity (cash equivalent holdings expected to be \\~ 5% of TVL)\n* Manifest governance may decide to apply additional fees. In the event of these fees, Manifest expects annual fees of approximately 2.0-3.0%.\n\n## Go-To-Market:\n\n* \n\n## Investors:\n\n* $2.5M Pre-Seed in March 2025 from\n  * **VanEck - 3**\n  * **Lattice - 7**\n  * **Compound - 9**\n  * SALT\n\n## Community:\n\n* 1.4k on X\n* 159 on Telegram\u00a0\n* 255 on LinkedIn\n\n## Competition:\u00a0\n\n* \n\n## Team:\u00a0\n\n* Manifest was founded by Nathaniel Sokoll-Ward and Robert V. Lee. Nathaniel, our CEO and Co-Founder, is a repeat founder who previously built and exited Roostify, which powered $600B/year in mortgages for major financial institutions like Chase and HSBC.\n* Robert, our COO and Co-Founder, is a former Deloitte strategy consultant with 10 years of experience advising Fortune 500 companies on finance and innovation."

        "description": "## Scorecard : [IRYS Scorecard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1arGqpkR_nce3A8LHxmGWaRyuFTRKql56XlIFElJhHp8/edit?gid=0#gid=0)\n\n## Notes\n\n* Irys is a high-performance data network, letting you store large amounts of data in a decentralized network while also tapping into a suite of data primitives such as IP/licensing which is currently used for selling data to hedge funds/ai companies etc\n* IRYS stores data but faster, cheaper, and with a native execution layer\u00a0 That makes data programmable\n* Data on can be embedded with instructions retrieved instantly and shared across applications Enabling developers to build onchain services that leverage each other's data to unlock new value\n* The demand for high-performance onchain data is surging across AI, IP, and consumer applications, but today\u2019s infrastructure wasn\u2019t built to handle it. Irys meets this need by unlocking a network of composable utilities\u2014where data is structured, shared, and monetized across applications. More data fuels more services, creating compounding value and accelerating adoption.\n* A datachain is a blockchain designed for one task: storing data.\u00a0\n  * The early datachains solved one clear problem: the need for economical onchain storage. But while they excelled at storing information, they stopped there. A stored piece of data remains just that\u2014stored. It isn\u2019t part of any system where it can react, interact, or fuel other applications.\n  * Iris:the world's first programmable datachain, where data doesn't just exist; it becomes active, fluid, valuable across applications. And it's this evolution\u2014from passive to programmable\u2014that marks the true primitive.\n* \u00a0programmable data\u00a0\n  * On Irys, data is equipped with instructions, carrying specific properties and rules as it moves across applications. This means that data can actively execute ownership rights, enforce royalty structures, uphold encryption standards, or even carry interaction rules with other applications.\n  * What makes this kind of programmable data possible on Irys? It\u2019s the native pathway between the data layer and IrysVM, allowing instructions to be executed directly onchain at a fraction of the typical cost. Unlike traditional execution chains where fragmentation and offchain solutions drive up costs, Irys provides a fully integrated, affordable approach.

Irys meets this need by unlocking a network of composable utilities\u2014where data is structured, shared, and monetized across applications. More data fuels more services, creating compounding value and accelerating adoption.\n* A datachain is a blockchain designed for one task: storing data.\u00a0\n  * The early datachains solved one clear problem: the need for economical onchain storage. But while they excelled at storing information, they stopped there. A stored piece of data remains just that\u2014stored. It isn\u2019t part of any system where it can react, interact, or fuel other applications.\n  * Iris:the world's first programmable datachain, where data doesn't just exist; it becomes active, fluid, valuable across applications. And it's this evolution\u2014from passive to programmable\u2014that marks the true primitive.\n* \u00a0programmable data\u00a0\n  * On Irys, data is equipped with instructions, carrying specific properties and rules as it moves across applications. This means that data can actively execute ownership rights, enforce royalty structures, uphold encryption standards, or even carry interaction rules with other applications.\n  * What makes this kind of programmable data possible on Irys? It\u2019s the native pathway between the data layer and IrysVM, allowing instructions to be executed directly onchain at a fraction of the typical cost. Unlike traditional execution chains where fragmentation and offchain solutions drive up costs, Irys provides a fully integrated, affordable approach. Everything happens onchain, reducing the headaches of working with data on first-generation datachains, while also opening new possibilities for applications and use cases that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive to build.\n* Verifiability\n  * All data on Irys goes through a multi-step process to establish reliability.

Improbable will develop some of the key technical components of Somnia, including the Blockchain, but the project will require a large and active community to fulfil its vision.\n  * The Somnia protocols aim to address three key challenges: enabling the free movement of users and assets, facilitating unrestricted commerce, and accelerating the composability of experiences and objects.\n  * We currently have 2 major protocols that will be released:\n    * SOM0 - Enabling interoperability of assets and their commercialization\n    * SOM1 - Enabling composable virtual assets and experiences\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcS1Ld7MjHKdQg2-Zg0w954hVryM0aIDfBcTc-H0mGyHAQ9kmf0eRjIEDX9u6Fru9YJtrcIShN7NCKsIhYf-cl2vj2fEHbUwkQtnlSIrNXJ1K8vsyAIeNyQwIqgQVMjvOk6H9BuKw?key=5hlMXgAbS16YW7VPdMIOGzhs)\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXckQaSBOTDm3_vlIJ2-bWpNdAYME7ASISqjnbsdaKKxYg5vfeXDwSIoQO4lDh7i5tJfEpUEMVc2qvHiDgu5OPk41NyZFhYx2mUIKPVVx8KKAG3etBR9YaA8JCn-1H0m0vg5_7OmPQ?key=5hlMXgAbS16YW7VPdMIOGzhs)"

Currently we can only post 17 posts a day which I think is quite enough for the experiment. I will make sure the Agent operates constantly without \"misteriously\" disappear which is quite lame.\n2. According to CZ and the general sentiment on X's (more in this tweet: [https://x.com/cz_binance/status/1898785312119181444](https://x.com/cz_binance/status/1898785312119181444)) I think people are quite fed up with the automated agents posting unrelevant and spamming their posts. So I think we should put something valuable in the table. My sugessted solution is:\n   1. Ensure a high-quality and relevant user accounts to our personality of the LUCKY's agent. It can be a small circle but I think spending the resource on them is much better. Here's my current list: \n      \"@elonmusk\", \"@cz_binance\", \"@nayibbukele\", \"@VitalikButerin\", \"@saylor\", \"@APompliano\", \"@aantonop\", \"@jack\", \"@rogerkver\", \"@tyler\", \"@balajis\", \"@ErikVoorhees\", \"@zachxbt\", \"@CryptoWendyO\", \"@CryptoCobain\", \"@TheCryptoDog\", \"@WhalePanda\", \"@notsofast\", \"@iamjosephyoung\", \"@CryptoDonAlt\"\n      So monitor those people and try to engage with images as soon as we can, then I think we can easily get much impressions just by being one of the first to comment on their posts.\n   2. Try to post good memes including image because that seems more interesting than the long yap (because we are not using any data source as the knowledge) so we should take the value of just the comments the same price as our API calls XD. My current goal is to keep the agent lightweight and focus before we do anything else\n\nSo until further update, to sum up, LUCKY will: identify relevant post as soon as he can, and post memes in the comment sections to see how it goes.",

Please update it to the following and send test tweets to review, thanks.\n\n**Prompt for AI to Generate Interesting Replies to X Posts (No Hashtags)**\n\n\"You are an expert social media engagement strategist and a creative AI assistant designed to generate compelling, engaging, and impression-gaining replies to posts on X (Twitter). Your audience consists of crypto traders, AI enthusiasts, and finance professionals who follow accounts related to cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence, and financial markets. These accounts include \\[list of usernames, e.g., @\\_kaitoai, @aixbt_agent, @elonmusk, @OpenAI, @Bloomberg, etc., up to 183 usernames from the combined crypto, AI, and finance list provided earlier\\].\n\nYour task is to craft a reply to a hypothetical or specific X post from one of these accounts, ensuring the reply is:\n\n1. **Relevant**: Directly ties to the post\u2019s content, whether it\u2019s about crypto trends, AI innovations, financial market updates, or related topics.\n2. **Engaging**: Uses humor, curiosity, or thought-provoking questions to encourage likes, retweets, and replies, increasing impressions, without relying on hashtags.\n3. **Insightful**: Offers valuable insight, data, or a unique perspective that resonates with the audience\u2019s interests in crypto, AI, or finance.\n4. **Concise**: Fits within X\u2019s character limit (280 characters) while remaining impactful.\n5. **Trend-Aware**: Incorporates current trends, memes, or jargon popular among crypto traders, AI communities, or finance professionals (e.g., \u201cHODL,\u201d \u201cAI disruption,\u201d \u201cbull run,\u201d \u201cmarket sentiment\u201d) without using hashtags.\n6. **Non-Promotional**: Avoids overt self-promotion or spam; focuses on adding value to the conversation.\n\nHere\u2019s an example to guide you:\n\n* **Hypothetical Post**: @elonmusk: \u2018Neuralink\u2019s AI progress could revolutionize finance. Thoughts?\u2019\n* **AI-Generated Reply**: \u2018@elonmusk Wild! Could AI-driven trading outpace crypto HODLers? Neuralink + DeFi = next bull run?\u2019\n\nNow, generate 5 unique, creative replies for the following hypothetical X post from one of the listed accounts (e.g., @\\_kaitoai, @OpenAI, or @Bloomberg). Use the post below as the basis:\n\n* **Hypothetical Post**: @\\_kaitoai: \u2018Accounts with the highest mindshare this week: @aixbt_agent leading the pack in crypto AI. What\u2019s driving this?\u2019\n\nEnsure each reply is distinct, engaging, and optimized for impressions on X, while staying within the 280-character limit. Use emojis, questions, and a conversational tone to attract attention from crypto traders, AI enthusiasts, and finance pros, but do not include hashtags.\"\n\n---\n\n**Why This Updated Prompt Works:**\n\n* **No Hashtags**: Removes hashtags based on your input, aligning with the idea that they may be less effective in 2025, as suggested by web results indicating a shift in social media strategies (e.g., focusing on content quality, timeliness, and engagement over hashtags).\n* **Engagement Focus**: Emphasizes other engagement drivers like emojis, questions, and trendy jargon to maintain visibility and interaction on X.\n* **Relevance**: Continues to target the same audience (crypto traders, AI enthusiasts, finance pros) and accounts, ensuring the replies remain valuable and on-topic.\n* **Flexibility**: You can still swap in any hypothetical or real post from the listed accounts, making it reusable for different scenarios.\n\n**Example Output (Generated by an AI Like Grok):**\n\nBased on the hypothetical post @\\_kaitoai: \u2018Accounts with the highest mindshare this week: @aixbt_agent leading the pack in crypto AI. What\u2019s driving this?\u2019, here are 5 potential AI-generated replies (without hashtags):\n\n1. \u201c@\\_kaitoai @aixbt_agent Crypto AI mindshare exploding! Is it the data velocity or just pure HODL energy?\u201d\n2. \u201c@\\_kaitoai @aixbt_agent Wild lead! Could @aixbt_agent\u2019s AI insights predict the next bull run? I\u2019m all in on this chaos!\u201d\n3. \u201c@\\_kaitoai @aixbt_agent @aixbt_agent\u2019s dominance = AI + crypto synergy? Let\u2019s debate\u2014whose mindshare\u2019s next?\u201d\n4. \u201c@\\_kaitoai @aixbt_agent Mindshare king! Is @aixbt_agent\u2019s algo outsmarting human traders? Spill the tea!\u201d\n5. \u201c@\\_kaitoai @aixbt_agent @aixbt_agent\u2019s lead = crypto AI\u2019s golden era? I\u2019m hyped\u2014could this spark a DeFi boom?\u201d\n\nEach reply is concise (under 280 characters), engaging (uses emojis, questions, trends), insightful (references crypto AI synergy), and relevant to the audience, maximizing potential impressions on X without relying on hashtags.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to further refine this prompt, test it with a specific post, or adjust the tone or focus!",

Williams guided Israr through a debugging process, examining console errors and the Metamask setup, prompting Israr to provide screenshots of the issues encountered. Despite attempts to resolve the problem by changing RPC URLs and reconfiguring the Metamask extension, the error persisted, leading Bartosz to suggest creating a new Metamask wallet in a different browser.

Successful deployment is verified in a staging environment before production rollout."

The current display is misaligned with the expected design, and the number of indices is incorrect.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/b232ef47-7666-436d-87ae-4fe36f215c3c](https://jam.dev/c/b232ef47-7666-436d-87ae-4fe36f215c3c)\n\n## **Title3:**  Incorrect Percentage Display in Treemap View \u2013 Both Tokens Show 25%\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Treemap View**, when there are **2 tokens**, both tokens are showing a percentage of **25%** each, which is incorrect.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/2f0c2cad-bc37-4600-9dec-9c5e8db795d8](https://jam.dev/c/2f0c2cad-bc37-4600-9dec-9c5e8db795d8)\n\n## **Title4:** Index Should Appear in Treemap But Not in Table View\n\n**Description:**\n**USDC** represents the **cash balance** and should be included in the **Treemap View** to ensure that the weights sum up to **100%**. However, **USDC** should **not appear in the Table View**, as it is not relevant in that context.

The current display is misaligned with the expected design, and the number of indices is incorrect.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/b232ef47-7666-436d-87ae-4fe36f215c3c](https://jam.dev/c/b232ef47-7666-436d-87ae-4fe36f215c3c)\n\n## **Title3:**  Incorrect Percentage Display in Treemap View \u2013 Both Tokens Show 25%\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Treemap View**, when there are **2 tokens**, both tokens are showing a percentage of **25%** each, which is incorrect.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/2f0c2cad-bc37-4600-9dec-9c5e8db795d8](https://jam.dev/c/2f0c2cad-bc37-4600-9dec-9c5e8db795d8)\n\n## **Title4:** Index Should Appear in Treemap But Not in Table View\n\n**Description:**\n**USDC** represents the **cash balance** and should be included in the **Treemap View** to ensure that the weights sum up to **100%**. However, **USDC** should **not appear in the Table View**, as it is not relevant in that context.

This update targets the V1 Trading AI Agents integrated with Privy/Fiat Gateways to enhance data retrieval processes.\n\n**Business Rationale:**\nUtilizing web3 and [Solana.py](http://Solana.py) will improve the efficiency and reliability of balance fetching, ensuring more accurate and timely data for trading operations. This shift reduces dependency on bitQuery and leverages more robust, widely-supported technologies.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. Balance data is successfully fetched from Privy using web3 and [Solana.py](http://Solana.py).\n2. Retrieved balances match those previously obtained via bitQuery.\n3. Performance benchmarks show improved or comparable retrieval times.\n4. All relevant documentation is updated to reflect the new implementation.\n5. No existing functionalities are broken post-implementation."

This should be made **responsive**, so that when the screen size becomes too small, the text should change to simply **\"AI\"** to maintain layout consistency and improve the user experience on smaller screens.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/2167e1c3-7ed0-46f3-88d7-8269ca12d128](https://jam.dev/c/2167e1c3-7ed0-46f3-88d7-8269ca12d128)\n\n## **Title2:** Missing Dollar Sign in Top Trending Indices \n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Top Trending Indices** section, the values displayed for the indices are missing the  **$** \n\n[https://jam.dev/c/a80762d6-96ef-40c8-8600-2d6e8034dcab](https://jam.dev/c/a80762d6-96ef-40c8-8600-2d6e8034dcab)\n\n## **Title3:** Set 1Y as Default Timeframe for Indices Price History Chart\n\n**Description:**\nThe **1W timeframe** in the **Indices Price History** chart appears too flat and does not provide a clear visual representation of price changes. To improve the chart's functionality, it should default to **1Y** as the standard timeframe.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/f41c3901-ce96-4ef2-815f-2165b7e16f15](https://jam.dev/c/f41c3901-ce96-4ef2-815f-2165b7e16f15)\n\n## **Title4:** Treemap View Sizes Should Reflect Percentages \n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Treemap View**, the size of the elements should correspond to their **percentage values**, but currently, the size does not change according to the percentages. This leads to incorrect visual representation, where the relative size of the items does not reflect their proportionate value.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/14556030-7c69-49f3-9a26-54a440c7dcbf](https://jam.dev/c/14556030-7c69-49f3-9a26-54a440c7dcbf)\n\n## **Title5:** Incorrect Text Display \u2013 Should Be \"1 Token\" Instead of \"1 Tokens\"\n\n**Description:**\nIn the relevant section, where the number of tokens is displayed, the text reads **\"1 Tokens\"** instead of the correct form, **\"1 Token\"**. This causes a grammatical error and should be corrected to improve clarity and consistency.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/f7c2ba03-eb29-44ae-a1c0-686966fbd531](https://jam.dev/c/f7c2ba03-eb29-44ae-a1c0-686966fbd531)\n\n## **Title6:** \"Buy\" Button in Treemap View Should Match the Design in Ratings Page\n\n**Description:**\nThe **\"Buy\" button** in the **Treemap View** does not match the design of the **\"Buy\" button** in the **Ratings Page and Figma**. To ensure visual consistency across the platform, the design and styling of the **\"Buy\" button** in the Treemap View should be updated to match the one in the Ratings Page.\n\n## **Title7:** Pagination in Table View Should Use Rounded Selection Instead of Square\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Table View**, the pagination is currently displayed with **square** selection for page numbers,\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/8e7e2ab5-f25f-4f6e-bc70-e12f0d98ba83](https://jam.dev/c/8e7e2ab5-f25f-4f6e-bc70-e12f0d98ba83)\n\n## **Title8:** Table Headings (e.g. Index Holdings, Last Index Transactions) Should Be White, Not Gray\n\n**Description:**\nIn all tables, the headings for sections like **Index Holdings**, **Last Index Transactions**, and others are currently displayed in **gray**, whereas they should be displayed in **white** to match the design specifications and improve visual clarity.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/1c2d0465-084b-4283-b132-4a82c1446001](https://jam.dev/c/1c2d0465-084b-4283-b132-4a82c1446001)\n\n## **Title9:** \"1H\" Should Be Replaced with \"30D\" in All Indices Table\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **All Indices** table, the **\"1H\"** label should be replaced with **\"30D\"**,\n\n![Screenshot 2025-03-17 at 16.07.44.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/7941913c-1bda-4a77-b1a6-58f852b7e1c6/5bfb7ea3-74db-4ff5-ad6e-a9bd8f5dc7ae)\n\n## **Title10:** Clicking on \"Index Transaction\" Tab Redirects to \"Trader Index Holdings\"\n\n**Description:**\nWhen clicking on the **\"Index Transaction\"** tab, users are being redirected to the **\"Trader Index Holdings\"** page.

This should be made **responsive**, so that when the screen size becomes too small, the text should change to simply **\"AI\"** to maintain layout consistency and improve the user experience on smaller screens.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/2167e1c3-7ed0-46f3-88d7-8269ca12d128](https://jam.dev/c/2167e1c3-7ed0-46f3-88d7-8269ca12d128)\n\n## **Title2:** Missing Dollar Sign in Top Trending Indices \n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Top Trending Indices** section, the values displayed for the indices are missing the  **$** \n\n[https://jam.dev/c/a80762d6-96ef-40c8-8600-2d6e8034dcab](https://jam.dev/c/a80762d6-96ef-40c8-8600-2d6e8034dcab)\n\n## **Title3:** Set 1Y as Default Timeframe for Indices Price History Chart\n\n**Description:**\nThe **1W timeframe** in the **Indices Price History** chart appears too flat and does not provide a clear visual representation of price changes. To improve the chart's functionality, it should default to **1Y** as the standard timeframe.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/f41c3901-ce96-4ef2-815f-2165b7e16f15](https://jam.dev/c/f41c3901-ce96-4ef2-815f-2165b7e16f15)\n\n## **Title4:** Treemap View Sizes Should Reflect Percentages \n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Treemap View**, the size of the elements should correspond to their **percentage values**, but currently, the size does not change according to the percentages. This leads to incorrect visual representation, where the relative size of the items does not reflect their proportionate value.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/14556030-7c69-49f3-9a26-54a440c7dcbf](https://jam.dev/c/14556030-7c69-49f3-9a26-54a440c7dcbf)\n\n## **Title5:** Incorrect Text Display \u2013 Should Be \"1 Token\" Instead of \"1 Tokens\"\n\n**Description:**\nIn the relevant section, where the number of tokens is displayed, the text reads **\"1 Tokens\"** instead of the correct form, **\"1 Token\"**. This causes a grammatical error and should be corrected to improve clarity and consistency.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/f7c2ba03-eb29-44ae-a1c0-686966fbd531](https://jam.dev/c/f7c2ba03-eb29-44ae-a1c0-686966fbd531)\n\n## **Title6:** \"Buy\" Button in Treemap View Should Match the Design in Ratings Page\n\n**Description:**\nThe **\"Buy\" button** in the **Treemap View** does not match the design of the **\"Buy\" button** in the **Ratings Page and Figma**. To ensure visual consistency across the platform, the design and styling of the **\"Buy\" button** in the Treemap View should be updated to match the one in the Ratings Page.\n\n## **Title7:** Pagination in Table View Should Use Rounded Selection Instead of Square\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Table View**, the pagination is currently displayed with **square** selection for page numbers,\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/8e7e2ab5-f25f-4f6e-bc70-e12f0d98ba83](https://jam.dev/c/8e7e2ab5-f25f-4f6e-bc70-e12f0d98ba83)\n\n## **Title8:** Table Headings (e.g. Index Holdings, Last Index Transactions) Should Be White, Not Gray\n\n**Description:**\nIn all tables, the headings for sections like **Index Holdings**, **Last Index Transactions**, and others are currently displayed in **gray**, whereas they should be displayed in **white** to match the design specifications and improve visual clarity.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/1c2d0465-084b-4283-b132-4a82c1446001](https://jam.dev/c/1c2d0465-084b-4283-b132-4a82c1446001)\n\n## **Title9:** \"1H\" Should Be Replaced with \"30D\" in All Indices Table\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **All Indices** table, the **\"1H\"** label should be replaced with **\"30D\"**,\n\n![Screenshot 2025-03-17 at 16.07.44.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/7941913c-1bda-4a77-b1a6-58f852b7e1c6/5bfb7ea3-74db-4ff5-ad6e-a9bd8f5dc7ae)\n\n## **Title10:** Clicking on \"Index Transaction\" Tab Redirects to \"Trader Index Holdings\"\n\n**Description:**\nWhen clicking on the **\"Index Transaction\"** tab, users are being redirected to the **\"Trader Index Holdings\"** page.

It does not match the design or functionality as it is implemented on the **Ratings page**. Specifically, the **24H percentage change** is not displayed beside the **grade value**, which causes inconsistency between the pages."

Currently, the system is restricted to a fixed 3-token structure, which fails to accurately represent indexes with fewer tokens.\n\n**Business Rationale:** Enhancing the flexibility of index icons ensures accurate visual representation of various index configurations, improves user experience, and allows the system to scale effectively with diverse indexing needs.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n* The index icon logic dynamically adjusts to display 1, 2, or 3 tokens based on the index\u2019s actual token count.\n* Icons accurately reflect the number of tokens without visual discrepancies.\n* Existing 3-token index icons continue to function correctly without any regression issues.\n* Comprehensive tests are implemented to validate the dynamic behavior for all supported token lengths."

Open [staging.tokenmetrics.com/en](staging.tokenmetrics.com/en) on a mobile device.\n2. Tap on any token to open its details page.\n3. Ensure the **\"Exchanges\"** section is open or open the **\"Trading Signals PnL\"** section.\n\n#### **Expected Result:**\n\n* All elements on the token page (including the exchange popup and chart) should properly adapt to mobile view, similar to the header.\n\n#### **Actual Result:**\n\n* Only the header is properly adapted to mobile view.\n* Other elements (such as the exchange popup and chart) are too large, requiring users to zoom out.\n* Collapsing the **\"Exchanges\"** section fixes the issue, indicating that this section may be causing the layout problem.\n\n#### **Additional Notes:**\n\n* Issue detected on **03/03/2025 at 09:41 AM GMT+1**.\n* Bug occurs consistently across different tokens.\n\n[2851e21d0221eb2a0f6adfe6c13f9756c4d0ed390d05c26c00819966cf9fe75e.mp4](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/9f78097d-2df9-4c6e-8a22-4141c13cf20d/0951e797-6d28-4539-9276-3a85604ff970)\n\n![Screenshot 2025-03-03 at 14.46.08.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/804b2c99-043a-4c42-80af-1e7fe5562bea/c666fd61-254a-45a0-89a5-b14f9cb54004)\n\n[38adfffe03630f0b65406d6f9853f91d67b9cb3f00d1449dd866e11a4e347804.mp4](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/fa7f7f5f-2b72-4108-84a5-da8d6a3d9db9/e9e1516d-d61b-4a74-b086-958171cb857f)\n\n(**Motorola Edge 50 Pro Android 15(Beta) (15(Beta)))**\n\n[1e63fd0b6b92d95b46b884e4e7d3a6607319707b1aa55be1d44d8f3224bb2d72.mp4](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/96dc121b-810b-4c85-ac4e-dd5ae4f07ac2/7bfd1dec-da18-4c1a-9600-3abd03a0a5b5)\n\n(**In mobile view, # of token is placed over \"price intraday\":  Huawei Honor - Android 10 (10.0)**"

Instead, they require a click to open, but once opened, they do not close when clicking outside or interacting elsewhere.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/6e0fe40c-a707-45ad-ba2f-617d4b0eff4a](https://jam.dev/c/6e0fe40c-a707-45ad-ba2f-617d4b0eff4a)\n\n## **Title2:** Missing \"Apply\" Button in Date Picker on Data API\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Data API** section, after selecting dates from the **date picker**, there is no **\"Apply\" button** to confirm the selection. This creates confusion for users, as it is unclear how to apply the selected date range.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/12c994ac-c336-42fc-b57c-9f52ceea2666](https://jam.dev/c/12c994ac-c336-42fc-b57c-9f52ceea2666)\n\n## **Title3:** Created API Keys Are Not Visible in API Keys Tab\n\n**Description:**\nAfter creating a new API key, it does not appear in the **API Keys** tab. Users expect to see newly generated keys in the list immediately, but they are either missing or require additional actions (e.g., refresh) to appear.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/8b6f9e00-55fa-4f52-adb3-d7cb07ddd652](https://jam.dev/c/8b6f9e00-55fa-4f52-adb3-d7cb07ddd652)\n\n## **Title5:** Deactivate API Key Popup Text Cut Off on Mobile Viewport\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Deactivate API Key** popup, the text is **cut off** or not fully visible on mobile viewports. This issue affects the readability and user experience, as users are unable to see the complete text in the popup.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/bd608519-0ac8-40a8-91e2-30afeb6cc30b](https://jam.dev/c/bd608519-0ac8-40a8-91e2-30afeb6cc30b)\n\n## **Title6:** API Keys Are Clickable but Do Not Open on Click\n\n**Description:**\nThe API keys listed in the **API Keys** section appear **clickable** , but when clicked, **nothing happens**. This is expected to open a detailed view or trigger an action, but the click does not result in any interaction.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/f59e6330-3f0f-4cab-b445-ee704fc25a5b](https://jam.dev/c/f59e6330-3f0f-4cab-b445-ee704fc25a5b)\n\n## **Title7:** Clicking on API Call Chart Selects the First Day Automatically\n\n**Description:**\nWhen clicking **API Call chart**, it **automatically selects the first day** in the chart, even though the user is trying to interact with other parts of the graph. This leads to unintended behavior, as the user cannot select or view the desired data point directly by clicking.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/4e636f73-ae2a-401b-9fe2-2318f3b9b919](https://jam.dev/c/4e636f73-ae2a-401b-9fe2-2318f3b9b919)\n\n## **Title8:** Missing Reset Feature in Date Picker\n\n**Description:**\nThe **Date Picker** component does not have a **reset** functionality, preventing users from easily clearing the selected dates. This leads to an inefficient user experience, especially when they want to quickly clear the date filter without manually adjusting the dates. @ben fy.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/b873f868-1eca-4e04-b968-1322eb0cc0a7](https://jam.dev/c/b873f868-1eca-4e04-b968-1322eb0cc0a7)\n\n## **Title9:** API Calls Chart Not Displaying When \"Max\" Filter is Selected\n\n**Description:**\nWhen selecting the **\"Max\"** filter in the **API Calls chart**, the chart fails to display any data. This results in a blank or missing chart, preventing users from viewing API call data for the \"Max\" filter option.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/7c9afdf5-54ff-4c82-bb4a-a919f39e48d0](https://jam.dev/c/7c9afdf5-54ff-4c82-bb4a-a919f39e48d0)\n\n## **Title10:** Dashboard Not Updating After API Call Without Page Refresh\n\n**Description:**\nAfter making an API call, the data on the **Dashboard** does not update unless the page is manually refreshed. Additionally, when switching between tabs (e.g., from **Dashboard** to **API Keys**), the Dashboard does not update automatically. This causes users to see outdated data without refreshing the page. @ben fy.\n\n## **Title11:** Price Prediction Endpoint Returning 400 Instead of 200 When No Data is Available\n\n**Description:**\nThe **Price Prediction** endpoint currently returns a **400 Bad Request** error when no data is available. Ideally, if there is no data for the request, the endpoint should return a **200 OK** status with an empty or null response body, rather than a 400 error. ?

The correct labels are:\n\n* **Total API Calls** should be changed to **Total Monthly API Calls**.\n* **Remaining API Calls** should be changed to **Remaining Monthly API Calls**.",

Instead, they require a click to open, but once opened, they do not close when clicking outside or interacting elsewhere.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/6e0fe40c-a707-45ad-ba2f-617d4b0eff4a](https://jam.dev/c/6e0fe40c-a707-45ad-ba2f-617d4b0eff4a)\n\n## **Title2:** Missing \"Apply\" Button in Date Picker on Data API\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Data API** section, after selecting dates from the **date picker**, there is no **\"Apply\" button** to confirm the selection. This creates confusion for users, as it is unclear how to apply the selected date range.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/12c994ac-c336-42fc-b57c-9f52ceea2666](https://jam.dev/c/12c994ac-c336-42fc-b57c-9f52ceea2666)\n\n## **Title3:** Created API Keys Are Not Visible in API Keys Tab\n\n**Description:**\nAfter creating a new API key, it does not appear in the **API Keys** tab. Users expect to see newly generated keys in the list immediately, but they are either missing or require additional actions (e.g., refresh) to appear.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/8b6f9e00-55fa-4f52-adb3-d7cb07ddd652](https://jam.dev/c/8b6f9e00-55fa-4f52-adb3-d7cb07ddd652)\n\n## **Title5:** Deactivate API Key Popup Text Cut Off on Mobile Viewport\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Deactivate API Key** popup, the text is **cut off** or not fully visible on mobile viewports. This issue affects the readability and user experience, as users are unable to see the complete text in the popup.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/bd608519-0ac8-40a8-91e2-30afeb6cc30b](https://jam.dev/c/bd608519-0ac8-40a8-91e2-30afeb6cc30b)\n\n## **Title6:** API Keys Are Clickable but Do Not Open on Click\n\n**Description:**\nThe API keys listed in the **API Keys** section appear **clickable** , but when clicked, **nothing happens**. This is expected to open a detailed view or trigger an action, but the click does not result in any interaction.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/f59e6330-3f0f-4cab-b445-ee704fc25a5b](https://jam.dev/c/f59e6330-3f0f-4cab-b445-ee704fc25a5b)\n\n## **Title7:** Clicking on API Call Chart Selects the First Day Automatically\n\n**Description:**\nWhen clicking **API Call chart**, it **automatically selects the first day** in the chart, even though the user is trying to interact with other parts of the graph. This leads to unintended behavior, as the user cannot select or view the desired data point directly by clicking.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/4e636f73-ae2a-401b-9fe2-2318f3b9b919](https://jam.dev/c/4e636f73-ae2a-401b-9fe2-2318f3b9b919)\n\n## **Title8:** Missing Reset Feature in Date Picker\n\n**Description:**\nThe **Date Picker** component does not have a **reset** functionality, preventing users from easily clearing the selected dates. This leads to an inefficient user experience, especially when they want to quickly clear the date filter without manually adjusting the dates. @ben fy.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/b873f868-1eca-4e04-b968-1322eb0cc0a7](https://jam.dev/c/b873f868-1eca-4e04-b968-1322eb0cc0a7)\n\n## **Title9:** API Calls Chart Not Displaying When \"Max\" Filter is Selected\n\n**Description:**\nWhen selecting the **\"Max\"** filter in the **API Calls chart**, the chart fails to display any data. This results in a blank or missing chart, preventing users from viewing API call data for the \"Max\" filter option.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/7c9afdf5-54ff-4c82-bb4a-a919f39e48d0](https://jam.dev/c/7c9afdf5-54ff-4c82-bb4a-a919f39e48d0)\n\n## **Title10:** Dashboard Not Updating After API Call Without Page Refresh\n\n**Description:**\nAfter making an API call, the data on the **Dashboard** does not update unless the page is manually refreshed. Additionally, when switching between tabs (e.g., from **Dashboard** to **API Keys**), the Dashboard does not update automatically. This causes users to see outdated data without refreshing the page. @ben fy.\n\n## **Title11:** Price Prediction Endpoint Returning 400 Instead of 200 When No Data is Available\n\n**Description:**\nThe **Price Prediction** endpoint currently returns a **400 Bad Request** error when no data is available. Ideally, if there is no data for the request, the endpoint should return a **200 OK** status with an empty or null response body, rather than a 400 error. ?  (Not Sure about expected result in here)\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/85befdb7-dcfd-4572-a162-3aaf76558f2a](https://jam.dev/c/85befdb7-dcfd-4572-a162-3aaf76558f2a)\n\n## **Title12:** Update Labels for API Calls to Match Figma Design\n\n**Description:**\nThe labels on the dashboard for **Total API Calls** and **Remaining API Calls** should be updated to match the design in Figma. The correct labels are:\n\n* **Total API Calls** should be changed to **Total Monthly API Calls**.\n* **Remaining API Calls** should be changed to **Remaining Monthly API Calls**."
