By tapping into the trillion-dollar crypto asset market, Multipli enables users to earn sustainable yields of up to 35% APY on various assets.\n\n## Innovation:\n\n* The platform operates by leveraging real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, bringing tangible assets on-chain to unlock yield opportunities for traditionally non-yield-bearing assets such as stocks and commodities.\n* Multipli's approach includes integrating treasury-backed tokens and utilizing strategies like contango and funding rate mechanisms to generate consistent returns for users.\n* Key components of the platform encompass user-friendly staking processes, cross-chain compatibility, and a focus on security to ensure a seamless and trustworthy experience for participants.\n\n## Use Case / Features:\n\n* \n\n## Traction:\n\n* **500,000+ Users Onboarded:** Multipli has rapidly grown its community, welcoming half a million users with an impressive 160,000 daily active users engaging with our platform.\n* **Average APY of 31.28%:** Users have enjoyed exceptional average annual percentage yields on our private mainnet, showcasing the effectiveness of our yield strategies.\n* **$50 Million Total Value Locked (TVL):** Achieving this significant TVL reflects the strong trust and confidence our users have placed in Multipli.\n* **130 Million tORBs Distributed:** We have generously rewarded our early adopters and contributors with 130 million tORBs, underscoring our commitment to our community.\n* **Winner of Binance BIA 4th Edition:** Multipli was honored to win the 4th edition of the Binance BIA.\n\n## Tokenomics:\n\n* \n\n## Roadmap:\n\n**Genesis Testnet Phase (Before Mainnet Launch)**\n\n* **Purpose:** To test and refine our platform with the community's help.\n* Weightage: 70% of total tORBs allocation.\n* **Duration:** 2 months or 1M users, whichever comes first\n* **Highlights:**\n  * Users engaged with the platform, providing invaluable feedback.\n  * Early adopters earned tORBs, our testnet tokens representing contributions.\n\n**Arc Testnet Phase (After Mainnet Launch)**\n\n* **Purpose:** To continue refining features and ensuring robustness post-launch.\n* **Weightage:** 30% of total tORBs allocation.\n* **Duration:** 6 months or TGE, whichever comes first\n* **Highlights:**\n  * Additional testing with real-world variables.\n  * Further tORBs distribution to active participants.\n* Note: All tORBs accumulated during these phases will be converted to ORBs at a specific ratio during the Token Generation Event (TGE).\n\n**Season 1: Genesis**\n\n* **Objective:** Achieve the first $100 million in Total Value Locked (TVL).\n* **Weightage:** 50% of ORBs allocation.\n* **Duration:** 3 months or until the $100M TVL milestone is reached, whichever comes first.\n* **User Benefits:**\n  * **Yield Earnings:** Earn baseline yield between 15-25% on stablecoins and 8-12% on native tokens like BTC and ETH.\n  * **Boosted Yield:** Earn boosted yield from our partners.\n  * **xToken Distribution:** Receive xTokens in a 1:1 ratio for every token staked (e.g., stake 100 USDC, receive 100 xUSDC).\n  * **ORBs Accumulation:** Earn 10 ORBs for every day you hold $100 worth of xTokens.\n\n**Season 2: Growth**\n\n* **Objective:** Reach the next $300 million in TVL.\n* **Weightage:** 30% of ORBs allocation.\n* **User Benefits:**\n  * Continued yield earnings, though rates may adjust slightly as the platform scales.\n  * Ongoing xToken rewards and ORBs accumulation.\n  * Opportunity to leverage network effects through referrals.\n\n**Season 3: Moon**\n\n* **Objective:** Achieve the final $200 million in TVL, culminating in a total of $500 million.\n* **Weightage:** 20% of ORBs allocation.\n* **User Benefits:**\n  * Stable yield generation with a matured protocol.\n  * Final chances to accumulate ORBs before TGE.\n  * Solidify your position in the Multipli ecosystem.\n\n**Post-TGE Seasons**\n\nAfter the TGE, the adventure doesn't stop! We will have four seasons every year, during which ORBs will be emitted at a rate proportional to the protocol's revenue.\n\n* **Sustainable Growth:** As the protocol generates revenue, a portion will be redistributed to ORB holders.\n* **Continuous Engagement:** Regular seasons ensure ongoing opportunities for users to engage and earn.\n* **Community-Centric Development:** Future developments and improvements will be guided by ORB holders through governance.\n\n## Business Model:\n\n* \n\n## Go-To-Market:\n\n## Investors:\n\n* **Pantera - 4**\n* Elevation - 0\n* Spartan - 1\n* **Starkware - 2**\n* Goodwater - 0\n* **Protofund Venture Catalysts - 3**\n\n## Community:\n\n* 24k on X\n* 1.4k on Discord\u00a0\n\n## Competition:\u00a0\n\n* \n\n## Team:\u00a0\n\n* ",

By tapping into the trillion-dollar crypto asset market, Multipli enables users to earn sustainable yields of up to 35% APY on various assets.\n\n## Innovation:\n\n* The platform operates by leveraging real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, bringing tangible assets on-chain to unlock yield opportunities for traditionally non-yield-bearing assets such as stocks and commodities.\n* Multipli's approach includes integrating treasury-backed tokens and utilizing strategies like contango and funding rate mechanisms to generate consistent returns for users.\n* Key components of the platform encompass user-friendly staking processes, cross-chain compatibility, and a focus on security to ensure a seamless and trustworthy experience for participants.\n\n## Use Case / Features:\n\n* \n\n## Traction:\n\n* **500,000+ Users Onboarded:** Multipli has rapidly grown its community, welcoming half a million users with an impressive 160,000 daily active users engaging with our platform.\n* **Average APY of 31.28%:** Users have enjoyed exceptional average annual percentage yields on our private mainnet, showcasing the effectiveness of our yield strategies.\n* **$50 Million Total Value Locked (TVL):** Achieving this significant TVL reflects the strong trust and confidence our users have placed in Multipli.\n* **130 Million tORBs Distributed:** We have generously rewarded our early adopters and contributors with 130 million tORBs, underscoring our commitment to our community.\n* **Winner of Binance BIA 4th Edition:** Multipli was honored to win the 4th edition of the Binance BIA.\n\n## Tokenomics:\n\n* \n\n## Roadmap:\n\n**Genesis Testnet Phase (Before Mainnet Launch)**\n\n* **Purpose:** To test and refine our platform with the community's help.\n* Weightage: 70% of total tORBs allocation.\n* **Duration:** 2 months or 1M users, whichever comes first\n* **Highlights:**\n  * Users engaged with the platform, providing invaluable feedback.\n  * Early adopters earned tORBs, our testnet tokens representing contributions.\n\n**Arc Testnet Phase (After Mainnet Launch)**\n\n* **Purpose:** To continue refining features and ensuring robustness post-launch.\n* **Weightage:** 30% of total tORBs allocation.\n* **Duration:** 6 months or TGE, whichever comes first\n* **Highlights:**\n  * Additional testing with real-world variables.\n  * Further tORBs distribution to active participants.\n* Note: All tORBs accumulated during these phases will be converted to ORBs at a specific ratio during the Token Generation Event (TGE).\n\n**Season 1: Genesis**\n\n* **Objective:** Achieve the first $100 million in Total Value Locked (TVL).\n* **Weightage:** 50% of ORBs allocation.\n* **Duration:** 3 months or until the $100M TVL milestone is reached, whichever comes first.\n* **User Benefits:**\n  * **Yield Earnings:** Earn baseline yield between 15-25% on stablecoins and 8-12% on native tokens like BTC and ETH.\n  * **Boosted Yield:** Earn boosted yield from our partners.\n  * **xToken Distribution:** Receive xTokens in a 1:1 ratio for every token staked (e.g., stake 100 USDC, receive 100 xUSDC).\n  * **ORBs Accumulation:** Earn 10 ORBs for every day you hold $100 worth of xTokens.\n\n**Season 2: Growth**\n\n* **Objective:** Reach the next $300 million in TVL.\n* **Weightage:** 30% of ORBs allocation.\n* **User Benefits:**\n  * Continued yield earnings, though rates may adjust slightly as the platform scales.\n  * Ongoing xToken rewards and ORBs accumulation.\n  * Opportunity to leverage network effects through referrals.\n\n**Season 3: Moon**\n\n* **Objective:** Achieve the final $200 million in TVL, culminating in a total of $500 million.\n* **Weightage:** 20% of ORBs allocation.\n* **User Benefits:**\n  * Stable yield generation with a matured protocol.\n  * Final chances to accumulate ORBs before TGE.\n  * Solidify your position in the Multipli ecosystem.\n\n**Post-TGE Seasons**\n\nAfter the TGE, the adventure doesn't stop! We will have four seasons every year, during which ORBs will be emitted at a rate proportional to the protocol's revenue.\n\n* **Sustainable Growth:** As the protocol generates revenue, a portion will be redistributed to ORB holders.\n* **Continuous Engagement:** Regular seasons ensure ongoing opportunities for users to engage and earn.\n* **Community-Centric Development:** Future developments and improvements will be guided by ORB holders through governance.\n\n## Business Model:\n\n* \n\n## Go-To-Market:\n\n## Investors:\n\n* **Pantera - 4**\n* Elevation - 0\n* Spartan - 1\n* **Starkware - 2**\n* Goodwater - 0\n* **Protofund Venture Catalysts - 3**\n\n## Community:\n\n* 24k on X\n* 1.4k on Discord\u00a0\n\n## Competition:\u00a0\n\n* \n\n## Team:\u00a0\n\n* "

These fees, disbursed three times daily, align perpetual contract and spot prices, ultimately rewarding YUSD holders.\n* **Instant Liquidity:** With Aegis, you can earn yields without the hassle of staking, lockups, or waiting periods. This means you can trade YUSD freely at any time, 24/7.\n* **No Staking:** Accruing yields has never been easier. Simply hold YUSD and register your wallet in the Aegis system to start earning. There's no need to lock up your assets or participate in complex staking processes.\n* **Timeless Rewards:** Aegis rewards for holding YUSD are perpetual, meaning they are always available to claim as long as earned. This ensures you can continuously benefit from your holdings over time.\n\n## Use Case / Features:\n\n* **Delta-Neutral Position Opening Mechanism:** Aegis employs a delta-neutral position opening mechanism using Coin-M futures, providing unparalleled stability and yield generation.\n* **Unique Yield Generation Mechanism Without Staking:** Aegis introduces an innovative profit distribution mechanism that allows users to earn yields without staking, lockups, or waiting periods.\n* **Peg Stabilization Mechanism:** At Aegis, we have developed a sophisticated Peg Arbitrage Mechanism to ensure the stability and value of our delta-neutral stablecoin, YUSD. This mechanism leverages the concept of price discrepancies between YUSD on different markets and its intrinsic value, providing opportunities for cross-market arbitrage.\n  * Benefits of the Peg Arbitrage Mechanism\n    * **Stability:** Maintaining the peg ensures that YUSD remains a reliable and stable asset for users.\n    * **Transparency:** The mechanism operates transparently, allowing users to see and understand how price stability is achieved.\n    * **Profitability:** Users can take advantage of arbitrage opportunities, making YUSD an attractive option for traders and investors.\n  * By leveraging advanced arbitrage strategies, we ensure that YUSD remains a dependable and stable asset, providing value and security to our users.\n* **Off-exchange settlement:** At Aegis, we have implemented an off-exchange settlement model to ensure that user funds are protected at all times. By partnering with premier custodians, we eliminate the risks associated with centralized exchanges while maintaining seamless transaction efficiency.\n* **Real-Time Transparency: Aegis provides universal access to a comprehensive dashboard showcasing both off-chain and on-chain data for all Aegis operations.**\u00a0\n* **Insurance Fund: The Aegis Insurance Fund is an integral part of the Aegis Protocol, providing a financial buffer to ensure the stability of the YUSD stablecoin. It is designed to cover any costs incurred during periods of negative funding rates, ensuring that YUSD is stable even in less favorable market conditions.**\n* **Mint Security Layer: The Mint Security Layer in the Aegis Protocol is designed to ensure the integrity and security of the YUSD stablecoin minting process. This layer includes several key components:**\n  * **Collateral Verification: Before minting YUSD, the system verifies that the collateral provided (USDT, DAI, or USDC) is secure and meets all necessary criteria.**\n  * **Over-the-Counter (OTC) Transactions: Once the collateral is received, it is converted into Bitcoin (BTC) through trusted OTC desks. This process is designed to be efficient, with a maximum time lag of 15 minutes to minimize exposure to market volatility.**\n  * **Custodial Security: The acquired BTC is securely stored with trusted third-party custodians. These custodians are selected based on their robust security protocols and reliability, ensuring that the assets are well-protected.**\n  * **Smart Contract Governance: The minting process is governed by smart contracts that automate and secure the creation of YUSD. These contracts enforce rules and conditions, preventing unauthorized or erroneous transactions.**\n  * **Transparency and Monitoring: The entire minting process, including collateral verification and BTC acquisition, is transparent and can be monitored in real-time through the Aegis public dashboard. This transparency ensures that all actions are accountable and visible to users.**\n* **Scalability:** The BTC COINM (coin-margined) futures market is a significant and growing segment of the cryptocurrency derivatives market. As of 2024, BTC COINM Open Interest (OI) represents approximately 26% of the total perpetual futures market, with a current value of around $7 billion. Historically, this percentage has reached as high as 51%, indicating substantial market participation.\n* **Liquidity:** Liquidity is a cornerstone of the Aegis YUSD stablecoin, ensuring stability and efficient market operations. The YUSD ecosystem benefits from the significant liquidity of the BTC COINM futures market, which provides a deep pool of capital to support trading activities. This liquidity is crucial for minimizing price slippage and ensuring smooth transactions, even during periods of high market volatility.\n\n## Traction:\n\n## Tokenomics:\n\n* The AEG token is a cornerstone of the Aegis Protocol, essential for its governance and decision-making processes.\n\n## Roadmap:\n\n* \n\n## Business Model:\n\n* \n\n## Go-To-Market:\n\n* \n\n## Investors:\n\n* $2M Pre-Seed in February 2025 from\n  * Dewhales - 0\n  * Profluent Ventures\u00a0\n\n## Community:\n\n* 2.4k on X\n* 610 on LinkedIn\n* 2k on Telegram\u00a0\n\n## Competition:\u00a0\n\n* \n\n## Team:\u00a0\n\n* ",

This project seamlessly integrates Web3 and traditional finance technologies to address the critical need for optimizing business cash flows while mitigating credit risk.\n* Kasu is a Real World Asset (RWA) business lending protocol that delivers on-chain yield by bringing together DeFi lenders, institutional loan managers and real world business borrowers. Borrowers comprise high creditworthy businesses, underpinned by real world cash flows and sound credit risk structuring.\n\n## Innovation:\n\n* Kasu not only democratises access to real world yield opportunities that are otherwise only available to institutional investors, but our proprietary technology applies innovative risk structuring and cash flow optimisation tools to improve credit risk. Ultimately, this delivers superior risk management.\n* We achieve this by partnering with Apxium Technologies Limited - a global SaaS+FinTech leader with proprietary Accounts Receivables Automation Software + Smart Global Payment Rails, delivering the most intelligent working capital financing solutions for high creditworthy businesses. This includes some of the largest accounting firms in the world, for which Apxium currently manages over $2.5B in annual invoicing.\n\n## Use Case / Features:\n\n* Our partnership with Apxium provides us with proprietary technology that optimises businesses\u2019 cash flows to improve credit risk, ultimately delivering superior risk management and higher quality yields.\n\n* **SMART INVOICING & PROPOSALS:** Automated with payment links & reminders\n* **GLOBAL PAYMENT SERVICES:** Smart Payment Gateway, Direct Debit, Instalments\n* **SMART FINANCING SOLUTIONS:** Automated Accounts Receivable & Payables Financing\n\n## Traction:\n\n## Tokenomics:\n\nLock $KSU to achieve tiered Loyalty Levels and avail of the following utility and rewards:\n\n* **Priority Access:** Access exclusive Lending Strategies before they\u2019re oversubscribed.\n* **Priority Withdrawals:** Access your funds faster than Lenders who haven\u2019t locked $KSU.\n* **Protocol Fee Sharing:** Share in the success you helped Kasu create.\n* **Yield Bonuses:** The higher your Loyalty Level, the higher your APY bonus.\n\nThe Kasu Token ($KSU) is a utility token that has a supply limited to one billion tokens. In order for Lenders to maximise the associated benefits, KSU must be locked for either 30, 180, 360 or 720 days in order to achieve tiered Loyalty Levels. Each KSU locking period will generate a specific amount of temporary, non-redeemable and non-transferrable rKSU tokens that will accumulate, so long as KSU remains locked.\n\n* Lenders who are also KSU Token Lockers are entitled to Protocol Fee Sharing, paid in USDC.

Ultimately, this delivers superior risk management.\n* We achieve this by partnering with Apxium Technologies Limited - a global SaaS+FinTech leader with proprietary Accounts Receivables Automation Software + Smart Global Payment Rails, delivering the most intelligent working capital financing solutions for high creditworthy businesses. This includes some of the largest accounting firms in the world, for which Apxium currently manages over $2.5B in annual invoicing.\n\n## Use Case / Features:\n\n* Our partnership with Apxium provides us with proprietary technology that optimises businesses\u2019 cash flows to improve credit risk, ultimately delivering superior risk management and higher quality yields.\n\n* **SMART INVOICING & PROPOSALS:** Automated with payment links & reminders\n* **GLOBAL PAYMENT SERVICES:** Smart Payment Gateway, Direct Debit, Instalments\n* **SMART FINANCING SOLUTIONS:** Automated Accounts Receivable & Payables Financing\n\n## Traction:\n\n## Tokenomics:\n\nLock $KSU to achieve tiered Loyalty Levels and avail of the following utility and rewards:\n\n* **Priority Access:** Access exclusive Lending Strategies before they\u2019re oversubscribed.\n* **Priority Withdrawals:** Access your funds faster than Lenders who haven\u2019t locked $KSU.\n* **Protocol Fee Sharing:** Share in the success you helped Kasu create.\n* **Yield Bonuses:** The higher your Loyalty Level, the higher your APY bonus.\n\nThe Kasu Token ($KSU) is a utility token that has a supply limited to one billion tokens. In order for Lenders to maximise the associated benefits, KSU must be locked for either 30, 180, 360 or 720 days in order to achieve tiered Loyalty Levels. Each KSU locking period will generate a specific amount of temporary, non-redeemable and non-transferrable rKSU tokens that will accumulate, so long as KSU remains locked.\n\n* Lenders who are also KSU Token Lockers are entitled to Protocol Fee Sharing, paid in USDC. The higher the Lender's Loyalty Level, the more share of Protocol Fees they are entitled to.\n\n## Roadmap:\n\n## Business Model:\n\n## Go-To-Market:\n\n## Investors:\n\n* $3M Seed in January 2024 from\n  * Morningstar Ventures - 0\n  * Woodstock Fund - 0\n  * **Faculty Group - 7**\n  * Cypher Capital - 0\n  * Rarestone Capital - 0\u00a0\n  * NxGen - 0\n  * Optic Capital - 0\n  * Andromeda Capital - 0\n  * Asteroid Capital - 0\n  * Matterblock - 0\u00a0\n\n## Community:\n\n* 40k on X\n* 20k on Discord\u00a0\n* 14.5k on Telegram\u00a0\n* 358 on Medium\u00a0\n* 526 on LinkedIn\n\n## Competition:\u00a0\n\n## Team:\u00a0"

Think machine learning training, CDNs, gaming - anything that needs guaranteed low latency and high bandwidth.\n* The Federal Communications Commission has estimated that only 35% of installed fiber in the United States is being utilized, with 65% remaining unutilized. A modern fiber link, whether terrestrial or subsea, can support hundreds of terabits of data per second.\n\nDoubleZero delivers two critical improvements:\n\n**Increased Bandwidth:**\n\n* Dedicated fiber links\n* Optimized traffic management\n* Specialized hardware at network edges\n* Efficient multicast functionality\n\n**Reduced Latency:**\n\n* Direct fiber routes\n* Edge processing with FPGAs\n* Predictable, low-latency paths\n* Priority routing for time-sensitive data\n\nDoubleZero isn't just an upgrade to existing infrastructure; it's a complete paradigm shift in how we think about blockchain networking.\n\n## Innovation:\n\n* The protocol enables permissionless contribution of independent fiber links to create a dynamic and expansive low-level high performance global network.\n* DoubleZero is not just a transport layer \u2013 the network provides filtration and verification services, conducted by network devices running open source code, to perform signature verification and deduplification on inbound data.\n\nDoubleZero is creating what we call an **\"N1\" (Network Layer 1)** - a private networking stack similar to what high-frequency trading firms use, but decentralized and permissionless.\n\nThink of it as a two-ring system:\n\n**The Outer Ring (The Moat):** Filters out spam transactions before they even reach validators\n\n**The Inner Ring (The Castle):** A high-performance private fiber network for legitimate transactions.\n\n## Use Case / Features:\n\n* This decentralized network infrastructure layer enables systems like Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains to be freed of communication bottlenecks and approach the maximum performance.\n\nGlobally, there are enormous amounts of unused fiber sitting underground and undersea simply going to waste. DoubleZero connects these underutilized fiber links together to form a decentralized mesh network. Thanks to the creation of a decentralized framework with DoubleZero, fiber owners can now contribute their unused, existing bandwidth to the network via smart contracts and earn tokens in return.\n\nIt's a win-win:\n\n* Fiber owners monetize their dormant assets\n* The network gains dedicated, high-performance infrastructure\n* Validators get dramatically improved performance\n* Users experience faster, more efficient blockchains\n\nAnyone with underutilized private fiber links can contribute to the network, including:\n\n* Data center operators with excess connectivity\n* Enterprises with underutilized private network capacity\n* Telecommunications companies with dark fiber assets\n* Organizations with leased bandwidth they're not fully utilizing\n\nThe primary users include:\n\n* **Blockchain Validators** - Operators who verify transactions and maintain consensus on Layer 1 blockchains\n* **RPC Node Operators** - Services that provide API access to blockchains for dApps and users\n* **MEV Searchers/Builders** - Entities involved in maximal extractable value who require extremely low latency\n* **Layer 2 Operators** - Sequencers and validators for Layer 2 chains\n* Content Delivery Networks\n* Gaming Applications\n* AI/ML Training Operations\n* Enterprise Users\n\n## Traction:\n\n* The Firedancer client, designed to scale Solana to 1 million transactions per second, achieved this throughput on testnet running over the DoubleZero network.\n\n## Tokenomics:\n\n* Fiber owners join the network by joining their fiber links to DoubleZero, which are registered on smart contracts. In return, they earn tokens for their contribution turning idle fiber into value.\n\n## Roadmap:\n\n* Testnet beta goes live in March 2025\n* Mainnet in Q3 2025\n\n## Business Model:\n\n* \n\n## Go-To-Market:\n\n* \n\n## Investors:\n\n* $28M Private Token Sale in March 2025 from\n  * DragonFly Capital - 3\n  * **Multicoin Capital - 10**\n  * Borderless Capital - 2\n  * **Foundation Capital - 10**\n  * **Reciprocal Ventures - 6**\n  * Superscrypt - 1\n  * DBA - 0\n  * Frictionless\n\n## Community:\n\n* 17.1k on X\n* 9.8k on Discord\u00a0\n* 420 on LinkedIn\n\n## Competition:\u00a0\n\n* \n\n## Team:\u00a0\n\n* DoubleZero is created by Austin Federa, Andrew McConnell, and Mateo Ward, and launches with two core contributor teams, Firedancer and Malbec Labs.",

Think machine learning training, CDNs, gaming - anything that needs guaranteed low latency and high bandwidth.\n* The Federal Communications Commission has estimated that only 35% of installed fiber in the United States is being utilized, with 65% remaining unutilized. A modern fiber link, whether terrestrial or subsea, can support hundreds of terabits of data per second.\n\nDoubleZero delivers two critical improvements:\n\n**Increased Bandwidth:**\n\n* Dedicated fiber links\n* Optimized traffic management\n* Specialized hardware at network edges\n* Efficient multicast functionality\n\n**Reduced Latency:**\n\n* Direct fiber routes\n* Edge processing with FPGAs\n* Predictable, low-latency paths\n* Priority routing for time-sensitive data\n\nDoubleZero isn't just an upgrade to existing infrastructure; it's a complete paradigm shift in how we think about blockchain networking.\n\n## Innovation:\n\n* The protocol enables permissionless contribution of independent fiber links to create a dynamic and expansive low-level high performance global network.\n* DoubleZero is not just a transport layer \u2013 the network provides filtration and verification services, conducted by network devices running open source code, to perform signature verification and deduplification on inbound data.\n\nDoubleZero is creating what we call an **\"N1\" (Network Layer 1)** - a private networking stack similar to what high-frequency trading firms use, but decentralized and permissionless.\n\nThink of it as a two-ring system:\n\n**The Outer Ring (The Moat):** Filters out spam transactions before they even reach validators\n\n**The Inner Ring (The Castle):** A high-performance private fiber network for legitimate transactions.\n\n## Use Case / Features:\n\n* This decentralized network infrastructure layer enables systems like Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains to be freed of communication bottlenecks and approach the maximum performance.\n\nGlobally, there are enormous amounts of unused fiber sitting underground and undersea simply going to waste. DoubleZero connects these underutilized fiber links together to form a decentralized mesh network. Thanks to the creation of a decentralized framework with DoubleZero, fiber owners can now contribute their unused, existing bandwidth to the network via smart contracts and earn tokens in return.\n\nIt's a win-win:\n\n* Fiber owners monetize their dormant assets\n* The network gains dedicated, high-performance infrastructure\n* Validators get dramatically improved performance\n* Users experience faster, more efficient blockchains\n\nAnyone with underutilized private fiber links can contribute to the network, including:\n\n* Data center operators with excess connectivity\n* Enterprises with underutilized private network capacity\n* Telecommunications companies with dark fiber assets\n* Organizations with leased bandwidth they're not fully utilizing\n\nThe primary users include:\n\n* **Blockchain Validators** - Operators who verify transactions and maintain consensus on Layer 1 blockchains\n* **RPC Node Operators** - Services that provide API access to blockchains for dApps and users\n* **MEV Searchers/Builders** - Entities involved in maximal extractable value who require extremely low latency\n* **Layer 2 Operators** - Sequencers and validators for Layer 2 chains\n* Content Delivery Networks\n* Gaming Applications\n* AI/ML Training Operations\n* Enterprise Users\n\n## Traction:\n\n* The Firedancer client, designed to scale Solana to 1 million transactions per second, achieved this throughput on testnet running over the DoubleZero network.\n\n## Tokenomics:\n\n* Fiber owners join the network by joining their fiber links to DoubleZero, which are registered on smart contracts. In return, they earn tokens for their contribution turning idle fiber into value.\n\n## Roadmap:\n\n* Testnet beta goes live in March 2025\n* Mainnet in Q3 2025\n\n## Business Model:\n\n* \n\n## Go-To-Market:\n\n* \n\n## Investors:\n\n* $28M Private Token Sale in March 2025 from\n  * DragonFly Capital - 3\n  * **Multicoin Capital - 10**\n  * Borderless Capital - 2\n  * **Foundation Capital - 10**\n  * **Reciprocal Ventures - 6**\n  * Superscrypt - 1\n  * DBA - 0\n  * Frictionless\n\n## Community:\n\n* 17.1k on X\n* 9.8k on Discord\u00a0\n* 420 on LinkedIn\n\n## Competition:\u00a0\n\n* \n\n## Team:\u00a0\n\n* DoubleZero is created by Austin Federa, Andrew McConnell, and Mateo Ward, and launches with two core contributor teams, Firedancer and Malbec Labs."

Everything you need is in the SDK documentation.\n* Cycle Network employs Verifiable State Aggregation (VSA) to achieve chain abstraction\n* Key Components of Cycle Network\n  * Omni State Channel Indexer(OSCI)\n    * An Omni State Channel Indexer (OSCI) is a decentralized multi-chain indexer that operates omni-chain indexing with decentralized governance to allow for a trustless validation & determination of the state of the Cycle ledger at any given moment.\n  * Decentralized Aggregate Sequencer\n    * The Sequencer is a fundamental component of Cycle infrastructure which is responsible for managing transactions, generating blocks which are validated by mutual verification mechanism and aggregating transaction states.\n  * Zero- Knowledge Hardware Acceleration\n    * Cycle Network enhances the developer experience by using ZK Rollup to reduce the latency of Rollout.\n  * FullyHomomorphic Encryption\n    * CycleNetwork employs Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to enable computations on encrypted data without needing decryption. This ensures that sensitive information remains secure throughout cross-chain operations, offering complete privacy guarantees to users.\n* Cycle Network introduces a decentralized, bridgeless hub that seamlessly interconnects all blockchains. With the proliferation of Layer 2 solutions and numerous chains, this innovation ensures that end-users and developers are no longer isolated or fragmented. It enables everyone to share liquidity, pay gas fees, and sign transactions without the need for traditional bridges.\n* Cycle can be connected by using any EVM-supported wallet like MetaMask or can be directly accessed by JavaScript, which imports libraries such as Web3.js, Ether, etc. The recommended way to interact with Cycle is to use [Cycle-JS-SDK](https://app.gitbook.com/o/zsuLq6nkAsruS3oE16NY/s/TzgQbqR8ub1ustDteGf4/\\~/changes/32/cycle-js-sdk), which integrates multiple steps into a single function call to let developers easily access cycle's core features without concentrating on coding details.\n* Cycle Network is a universal, secure, and verifiable chain abstraction architecture, which will use the restaking service provided by Symbiotic to run some tasks, improving the security and availability of the system.Operators eligible to provide infrastructure for Cycle will obtain restake from Symbiotic, run DAC (Data Availability Committe) nodes, and provide decentralized DA (Data Availability) services for Cycle Network\n* Cycle Network presents an omni state solution based on Verifiable State Aggregation (VSA). From the perspective of layered blockchain architecture, the framework of Cycle can be represented as the Security Layer, the Extended Layers, and Cycle Layer.\n  * The Security Layer is defined as a blockchain layer that provides the safety and liveness of transaction state. This layer can be either Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other highly decentralized blockchain.\u00a0\n  * The Extended Layers refer to the source layers and destination layers where all transaction state and data state are located. This includes all Layer 1s, Layer 2s, and application blockchains.\u00a0\n  * The Extended Layers refer to the source layers and destination layers where all transaction state and data state are located.

Everything you need is in the SDK documentation.\n* Cycle Network employs Verifiable State Aggregation (VSA) to achieve chain abstraction\n* Key Components of Cycle Network\n  * Omni State Channel Indexer(OSCI)\n    * An Omni State Channel Indexer (OSCI) is a decentralized multi-chain indexer that operates omni-chain indexing with decentralized governance to allow for a trustless validation & determination of the state of the Cycle ledger at any given moment.\n  * Decentralized Aggregate Sequencer\n    * The Sequencer is a fundamental component of Cycle infrastructure which is responsible for managing transactions, generating blocks which are validated by mutual verification mechanism and aggregating transaction states.\n  * Zero- Knowledge Hardware Acceleration\n    * Cycle Network enhances the developer experience by using ZK Rollup to reduce the latency of Rollout.\n  * FullyHomomorphic Encryption\n    * CycleNetwork employs Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to enable computations on encrypted data without needing decryption. This ensures that sensitive information remains secure throughout cross-chain operations, offering complete privacy guarantees to users.\n* Cycle Network introduces a decentralized, bridgeless hub that seamlessly interconnects all blockchains. With the proliferation of Layer 2 solutions and numerous chains, this innovation ensures that end-users and developers are no longer isolated or fragmented. It enables everyone to share liquidity, pay gas fees, and sign transactions without the need for traditional bridges.\n* Cycle can be connected by using any EVM-supported wallet like MetaMask or can be directly accessed by JavaScript, which imports libraries such as Web3.js, Ether, etc. The recommended way to interact with Cycle is to use [Cycle-JS-SDK](https://app.gitbook.com/o/zsuLq6nkAsruS3oE16NY/s/TzgQbqR8ub1ustDteGf4/\\~/changes/32/cycle-js-sdk), which integrates multiple steps into a single function call to let developers easily access cycle's core features without concentrating on coding details.\n* Cycle Network is a universal, secure, and verifiable chain abstraction architecture, which will use the restaking service provided by Symbiotic to run some tasks, improving the security and availability of the system.Operators eligible to provide infrastructure for Cycle will obtain restake from Symbiotic, run DAC (Data Availability Committe) nodes, and provide decentralized DA (Data Availability) services for Cycle Network\n* Cycle Network presents an omni state solution based on Verifiable State Aggregation (VSA). From the perspective of layered blockchain architecture, the framework of Cycle can be represented as the Security Layer, the Extended Layers, and Cycle Layer.\n  * The Security Layer is defined as a blockchain layer that provides the safety and liveness of transaction state. This layer can be either Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other highly decentralized blockchain.\u00a0\n  * The Extended Layers refer to the source layers and destination layers where all transaction state and data state are located. This includes all Layer 1s, Layer 2s, and application blockchains.\u00a0\n  * The Extended Layers refer to the source layers and destination layers where all transaction state and data state are located. This includes all Layer 1s, Layer 2s, and application blockchains.\u00a0\n* CYCLE-CORE-SDK\n  * CYCLE-CORE-SDK is a highly integrated development tool that allows developers to easily implement their applications empowered by Cycle. It provides JavaScript interfaces to interact with Cycle Network in all aspects.

The Autonomous Worlds Engine (AWE) is a modular framework enabling the creation of self-sustaining worlds for scalable agent-agent and human-agent collaboration.\n\n## Solution:\n\n* STP Network is a blockchain project that seeks to expand the global use of digital assets. It has developed The Verse Network, which is an interconnect cloud that is built to serve DAOs and DeFi projects.\n* Standard Tokenization Protocol Token (STPT) plays a major role in the Verse Network, on which developer teams can build scalable, decentralized, and secure applications on top of the network.\n\n## Innovation:\n\n* The Verse Network aims to be highly scalable, censorship-resistant, and offer support for multiple virtual machines, not just EVM.\n* It is also resistant to front-running, this means that transactions will be validated in the order that they occur, and no one can manipulate the order by paying more.\n\nThe Autonomous Worlds Engine (AWE) is modular framework designed to create, simulate, and evolve persistent ecosystems where AI agents collaborate and adapt.\n\n* **World Orchestration Module:** Generates and governs Worlds, enforcing rules and simulating agent-environment interactions.\n* **Agent Orchestration Module:** Generates and governs AI agents with embedded autonomy.\n* **Event Orchestration Module:** Curates and evolves events that define the World\u2019s historical trajectory and agent incentives.\n\n## Use Case / Features:\n\nThe Verse Network\u2019s architecture is fundamental to the way it operates. It consists of four crucial layers:\n\n* Application Layer, this is where smart contracts and dApps are deployed;\n* Execution Layer, virtual machines are supported in this layer;\n* Network Layer, nodes are operated in this layer;\n* Consensus Layer, 1,000 of validators are responsible for providing rapid and secure transaction validation.\n\nThe Verse ecosystem has a strong focus on DAOs, as such supports dApps surrounding their functionality. This includes DAO builder dApps, DAO market data tools, as well as DAO reputation dApps.\n\n* Autonomous Worlds are dynamic persistent environments where Al Agents can collaborate and adapt to solve complex problems.\n* They enable transparent multi-agent simulations that could solve the challenges of today to shape the possibilities of tomorrow.\n* **Agent-Agent and Human-Agent Collaboration:** Foster dynamic interactions to tackle complex challenges collectively.\n* **Simulations and Economic Modeling:** Simulate and refine systems in a risk-free environment.\n* **Proof of Agent Autonomy:** Validate agent parameters and memory immutability.\n* **Scale Multi-Agent Simulation:** Enables hundreds of agents to collaborate in Autonomous Worlds. Reduce synchronization overhead, maximize parallelism and handle large scale environments with hundreds of agents.\n\nAWNS, which stands for **Autonomous Worlds Naming Service**, introduces a novel approach to digital identity with its unique domain ending, .aw. It serves as the foundational layer for the AW ecosystem, enabling users to effortlessly traverse Autonomous Worlds, participate in on-chain games, and engage with the broader web3 landscape.\n\n## Traction:\n\n* Our ecosystem consists of 15,000 progressive onchain token holders and world contributors.\n* Ecosystem: [https://www.stp.network/ecosystem](https://www.stp.network/ecosystem)\n\n## Tokenomics:\n\n* $STPT is the native token, launched in June 2019, climbed to an ATH of $280M and is currently trading at $204 MC and FDV.\n* STPT is the Verse Network\u2019s primary medium of exchange, it is an ERC-20 token. It can be used for paying fees on the platform as well as earning rewards.\n* STPT Holders are entitled to take part in platform governance, as well as making key proposals in the ecosystem.\n\n## Roadmap:\n\n* \n\n## Business Model:\n\n* \n\n## Go-To-Market:\n\n* \n\n## Investors:\n\n* $2M Pre-Seed in April 2019\n* $7M in Private Token Sale in May 2019 from\n  * Alphabit Digital Currency Fund - 0\n  * **Neo - 4**\n  * Block Capital - 0\n* $750k IEO in June 2019 on Bittrex platform.\n\n## Community:\n\n* 53k on X\n* 12.5k on Telegram\u00a0\n\n## Competition:\u00a0\n\n* \n\n## Team:\u00a0\n\n* "

Sending emails to a list of recipients which can include (TM employees,  TM subscribers)\n\nAnd the cost for a newsletter generated by AI is this log summary from running my code (this is Gemini, I will create some functions to calculate the cost for OpenAI API calls later but I believe their are much more expensive)\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/c94052c4-7700-4421-9c62-7f81f68e05fa/0b9ddb91-45db-47cb-acac-a495afed84ab)\n\nplus 0.4$-1.2$ (but very low probability that it costs 1.2$) for every images generated inside it. \n\nSo the final cost is: 0.033 + 0.4-1.2$ = 0.433$-1.233$ for a single newsletter.\n\n@ian @talha "

            "body": "## Perplexica's Issues\n\n1. **Cannot break down a search query into multiple sub-queries**\n2. If we give a link in the search query, it will limit itself to search only the website in the search query, which is actually pretty limiting. \n   1. When we give it a token's official website, usually the home page, then it will only search for information within the home page. \n   2. If we don't give it a link in the search query, it now can search for information from the whole internet, and in more pages (not just the official site's home page)\n   3. Ideally, giving it a website-link in the search query should NOT limit it to only search THAT website only, but it should be used to 'cross check' the obtained search results\n3. During research report generation process, it sometimes cannot filter out search results that are unrelated and wrong\n4. On the other hand, Perplexica has a high 'similarity score threshold' so there are instances where it decides to not output anything at all because all the search results have 'too-low similarity score'\n\n## Solution\n\n1. Rework the prompt & implement a sub-query 'splitting' mechanism\n2. Omit this functionality. If a website link is given in the search query, treat it as an information so later it can 'cross-check' the sources that it got from the internet. The website link in the query should 'refine' the search result, not 'limit it' to that website only\n   1. If needed, we can add more capabilities in the future in which we give another 'field' for the input query so it will scrape specific websites.\n3. In the research report generation prompt, add a specific instruction: \n   1. Telling the LLM that there could be multiple cryptocurrency project with the same name, and it should beware\n   2. Telling the LLM that it should still filter and reason which result from the internet that it can use to generate the report\n   3. Asking the LLM to be more critical and to verify the search results, whether the obtained results are relevant to the query prompt \n4. Lower the similarity score threshold\n   1. We should not worry that it will result in more 'trash' result being obtained, as we have prepared the report generation process with an updated prompt as outlined in step 3\n\n## Impact\n\nNow the Perplexica search result is much better, especially for our use case.\n\nHowever, this means that we cannot use Perplexica's official github page (it's master/main branch) as our customized Perplexica's code base is unique\n\n### Tests\n\n1. Asking it to search 'gaia.net':\n   1. Before: it is unable to differentiate between the \"GAIA\" project that involves AI and LLM, with another project named \"GAIA' that involves eco-friendly / sustainability / 'earth' initiatives\n   2. After: it is able to correctly filter out the \"GAIA\" project search result that is NOT the intended token\n2. Asking it to search for 'founder of TMAI and his background':\n   1. Before: it is only able to get the founder's name, with minimal background or experiences\n   2. After: it is able to not only get Mr. Ian Balina's name, but also his background and experiences",

            "body": "# Compared Vendors\n\n1. Perplexity, the leading AI Search provider, combining natural language querying and reasoning-driven web search. \n2. Tavily, having the same value proposition as Perplexity\n3. Perplexica, an open-source, self-hosted attempted replication of Perplexity\n\n# Why Firecrawl is not Compared\n\nFor Perplexity and Tavily, we only need to give it instructions in natural language, e.g \"founder of TMAI\" or \"funding and investment history on gaianet.ai\" and they will craft a structured report based on the query. \n\nFor Firecrawl, it is used to crawl and scrape websites, meaning that we need to already give it the URL of the website that we're going to scrape, and extract information.\n\nIf we give the official website to Firecrawl, for example: gaianet.ai, then it will only scrape the home page of the website, and not able to 'extend beyond' and seek inner pages. \n\nFirecrawl is inherently for crawling if we already know the URLs of the websites that we're going to scrape. In our use case, we instruct the LLM Providers to conduct a research based on our natural language words. This is not suitable for Firecrawl.\n\n# Our Use Case\n\nWe have 22 'searches' (22 instances of conducting internet-wide search) on various focused sections (project overview, founders, technology, architecture, market analysis, tokenomics, etc). These 22 searches will then be compiled into: \n\n* Deep Dive\n* Code Review\n* Investment Analysis\n* Investment Analysis, but in Bullet Points\n\nSo, 1 project will require 22 API Calls to these 'AI Search' providers. \n\n# Pricing\n\n1. Perplexity: $5 per 1000 searches\n2. Tavily: pay-as-you-go, $0.008 per 1 search\n3. Perplexica: just using our own OpenAI API Key\n\n# Simulation\n\n1. For Perplexity, 1 research process costs: $5 / 1000 \\* 22 = $0.11\n2. For Tavily, 1 search process costs: $0.008 \\* 22 = $0.176\n3. For Perplexica, running 10 simulation with a new OPENAI_API_KEY costs us an average of $0.02 from start to finish: conducting all 22 researches, until creating 4 final reports. \n\nThe calculation above has not even considered report writing for Perplexity and Tavily costs. Let's assume that report writing costs $0.01.\n\nAs we'll conduct 3000 research per week, this is our annual cost: \n\n* Perplexity will cost us: $0.12 \\* 3000 \\* 52 = $18,720\n* Tavily will cost us: $0.176 \\* 3000 \\* 52 = $27,456\n* Perplexica will cost us: $0.02 \\* 3000 \\* 52 = $3,120\n* Hybrid Approach: \n  * 20 Perplexica Searches + 2 Perplexity Searches = (($0.02 / 22)\\*20 + $0.01) \\* 3000 \\* 52 = $4396\n\n# Chosen Approach\n\nHybrid Approach works best, because while everything else can be researched well by Perplexica, there's 2 'sections' that the model quite consistently gets wrong: \n\n* Investor (Investment rounds, funding history)\n* Founder (founder and key team members)\n\ncc: @ian @vasilis @ayush ",

You don't need to configure the sizes prior to the simulation, from_signals allows you to set sizes dynamically where you can decide, at each timestamp, which size to order\n3.

This library should abstract common interactions, making it easier to read data, execute SQL, and write Pandas DataFrames seamlessly.\n\n#### **Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n* Develop a Python library with the following core functionalities:\n  * `read_sql(query)`: Fetch query results as a Pandas DataFrame.\n  * `execute_sql(query)`: Run SQL commands (e.g., DML/DDL operations).\n  * `write_pandas(df, table_name, mode)`: Efficiently write a Pandas DataFrame to StarRocks with configurable **append/overwrite** modes.\n* Ensure **connection pooling** for better performance.\n* Add support for authentication using **JDBC, MySQL connector, or StarRocks HTTP API**.\n* Implement logging and error handling for better debugging.\n* Provide unit tests and sample usage documentation.\n\n#### **Additional Context:**\n\n* This library aims to **standardize** interactions with StarRocks across **DE workflows**.\n* Should be **lightweight, performant, and easy to integrate** with existing pipelines.",

            "body": "Detail answer:\n\n**1. What is an Airflow DAG, and how do Operators and TaskGroups fit into it?**\n\n* **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**: A collection of tasks in Apache Airflow that define workflows and dependencies in a directed, non-cyclic manner.\n* **Operators**: The building blocks of a DAG that define what each task does (e.g., PythonOperator for running Python code, BashOperator for shell commands, etc.).\n* **TaskGroup**: A way to logically group multiple related tasks within a DAG, making complex workflows more readable and manageable.\n\n---\n\n### **2. What are the key differences between Kafka and SQS? Provide a use case to illustrate the difference.**\n\n| Feature | Apache Kafka | AWS SQS |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| Type | Distributed event streaming platform | Managed message queue service |\n| Ordering | Guaranteed per partition | FIFO available (but standard queue may not guarantee order) |\n| Message Retention | Configurable, can persist messages for days/weeks | Message removed after consumption (FIFO allows short-term retention) |\n| Consumer Model | Multiple consumers can read the same message | Message is typically removed once consumed |\n| Throughput | High | Moderate |\n| Use Case | Event-driven microservices, real-time analytics | Decoupling services, task queues |\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Use Case Example**:\n\n* **Kafka**: A real-time analytics system where logs from multiple sources are streamed to a processing engine for aggregation.\n* **SQS**: A task queue system where an application sends tasks (like image processing jobs) to workers that process them asynchronously.\n\n---\n\n### **3. What are Windows and Watermarks in real-time data processing, and why are they important?**\n\n* **Windows**: Time-based segments in which streaming data is grouped for processing. Common types include:\n  * **Tumbling Window**: Fixed-sized, non-overlapping windows.\n  * **Sliding Window**: Overlapping windows with a defined slide interval.\n  * **Session Window**: Dynamic windows based on activity gaps.\n* **Watermarks**: Mechanisms used to handle late-arriving data by defining a point where data is considered complete. Helps balance completeness vs. latency.\n\n\ud83d\udccc **Example**: In a real-time analytics pipeline, a **5-minute tumbling window** might aggregate sales data every 5 minutes, while **watermarks** ensure that late-arriving transactions are still processed if they arrive within a reasonable delay.\n\n---\n\n### **4. What is the difference between a stateless and a stateful application?**\n\n| Feature | Stateless | Stateful |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| Data Persistence | Does not retain client state between requests | Stores and manages state between requests |\n| Scaling | Easier to scale horizontally | More complex to scale due to state dependencies |\n| Example | REST APIs, Load Balancers | Databases, Session-based applications |\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Example**:\n\n* A **stateless** authentication service (e.g., JWT-based API) does not store session information; each request carries authentication data.\n* A **stateful** database service retains user session data across requests.\n\n---\n\n### **5. How does a Kubernetes Deployment differ from a StatefulSet?**\n\n| Feature | Deployment | StatefulSet |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| Purpose | Manages stateless applications | Manages stateful applications |\n| Pod Identity | All pods are identical | Each pod has a unique identity (stable network ID and storage) |\n| Scaling | Creates/destroys pods dynamically | Maintains ordered scaling and deletion |\n| Use Case | Web applications, microservices | Databases, Kafka, Zookeeper |\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Example**:\n\n* A **Deployment** is ideal for running a stateless web application with multiple replicas behind a load balancer.\n* A **StatefulSet** is necessary for running a distributed database (e.g., PostgreSQL, Cassandra), where each node requires a fixed identity and persistent storage.\n\n---\n\n### **6. How does Apache Pinot achieve fast query performance?**\n\nApache Pinot is optimized for ultra-low-latency OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) queries by using:\n\n1. **Columnar Storage** \u2013 Stores data in a columnar format for efficient scanning.\n2. **Indexes** \u2013 Utilizes forward indexes, inverted indexes, star-tree indexes, and bloom filters to speed up queries.\n3. **Pre-aggregations** \u2013 Performs partial aggregations during ingestion to reduce query-time computation.\n4. **Real-time and Batch Ingestion** \u2013 Handles both real-time streaming (e.g., Kafka) and batch data sources (e.g., Hadoop, S3).\n5. **Segment-Level Query Execution** \u2013 Breaks data into immutable segments, allowing queries to run in parallel across distributed nodes.\n6. **Approximate Queries** \u2013 Uses techniques like HyperLogLog to approximate results quickly when exact precision isn't necessary.\n\n\ud83d\udccc **Example Use Case**:\nApache Pinot powers real-time analytics dashboards, such as tracking user engagement metrics for millions of events per second (e.g., LinkedIn uses Pinot for real-time analytics on profile views).",

Used for real-time analytics.\n  * **SQS**: Managed message queue, messages are consumed once, mainly used for decoupling services.\n* **Windows & Watermarks in Real-time Processing**\n  * **Windows**: Define how streaming data is grouped over time (Tumbling, Sliding, Session).\n  * **Watermarks**: Handle late-arriving data by marking a point when data is considered complete.\n* **Stateless vs. Stateful Applications**\n  * **Stateless**: No memory of past requests, easier to scale (e.g., REST API).\n  * **Stateful**: Retains session/data across requests, harder to scale (e.g., databases).\n* **Deployment vs. StatefulSet**\n  * **Deployment**: For stateless apps, all pods are identical, dynamic scaling.\n  * **StatefulSet**: For stateful apps, maintains pod identity, ordered scaling.\n* **Apache Pinot\u2019s Fast Query Performance**\n  * Uses **columnar storage**, **indexes**, **pre-aggregations**, **parallel query execution**, and **real-time ingestion** to optimize OLAP queries.",

            "body": "If your priorities are keeping costs low, using open-source solutions, and avoiding vendor lock-in, we can focus on self-hosted, open-source alternatives to the APIs we discussed. This approach trades off the convenience of managed services for greater control, flexibility, and potentially zero usage-based costs (after accounting for infrastructure). I\u2019ll compare open-source options for both STT and TTS, leveraging the models behind the tools you mentioned where applicable, and provide guidance on setup and cost considerations.\n\n---\n\n**Open-Source STT Options**\n\n**1. Whisper (OpenAI)**\n\n* **Overview**: Open-source speech-to-text model released by OpenAI, the backbone of their Whisper API and Replicate\u2019s \"Incredibly Fast Whisper.\"\n* **Functionality**: Multilingual transcription (50+ languages), translation to English, high accuracy (WER \\~8% for English with v3).\n* **Performance**:\n  * Matches OpenAI\u2019s Whisper API accuracy but requires local optimization for speed.\n  * Base model processes \\~10-30 minutes per hour of audio on a decent CPU; GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA 3060) can reduce this to \\~1-2 minutes/hour.\n* **Open-Source Advantage**: No API costs, full control over model and data.\n* **Setup**:\n  * Install via Python: pip install openai-whisper.\n  * Models (tiny, base, small, medium, large) available on Hugging Face.\n  * Optional: Use faster-whisper (a CTranslate2-optimized version) for 4-10x speed gains.\n* **Cost**:\n  * Hardware: Run on existing CPU/GPU or cloud instance (e.g., AWS g4dn.xlarge, \\~$0.50/hour on-demand, cheaper with spot instances).\n  * No per-minute fees, only infrastructure costs.\n* **Comparison to Replicate\u2019s Fast Whisper**: Same underlying tech, but you control optimization (e.g., Distil-Whisper for speed) and avoid Replicate\u2019s per-second billing.\n\n**2. Mozilla DeepSpeech**\n\n* **Overview**: Open-source STT framework, though less maintained since Mozilla shifted focus (last major update \\~2021).\n* **Functionality**: English-focused, real-time capable with training for other languages.\n* **Performance**: WER 10-15% (less accurate than Whisper), faster for real-time (seconds/hour on GPU).\n* **Open-Source Advantage**: Lightweight, no vendor dependency.\n* **Setup**:\n  * Install via pip install deepspeech.\n  * Pre-trained models available, or train your own with custom data.\n* **Cost**: Same as Whisper\u2014hardware only.\n* **Why Consider?**: Simpler than Whisper for English-only, real-time use cases, but less versatile.\n\n**Whisper Alternatives Worth Noting**\n\n* **Kaldi**: Older, highly customizable STT toolkit. Steeper learning curve, but free and powerful for research-grade transcription.\n* **Wav2Vec 2.0 (Hugging Face)**: Open-source, transformer-based STT from Meta AI. Comparable to Whisper, multilingual, but requires fine-tuning for peak performance.\n\n---\n\n**Open-Source TTS Options**\n\n**1. XTTS-v2 (Coqui)**\n\n* **Overview**: The open-source model behind Replicate\u2019s \"XTTS-v2,\" developed by Coqui (now sunsetted, but community-maintained).\n* **Functionality**: Multilingual (17+ languages), voice cloning with \\~6-second samples, expressive speech synthesis.\n* **Performance**:\n  * High-quality output, comparable to commercial TTS (e.g., OpenAI), with natural prosody.\n  * Latency \\~1-3 seconds for short inputs on GPU, scalable with optimization.\n* **Open-Source Advantage**: No API fees, full customization (e.g., fine-tune voices or languages).\n* **Setup**:\n  * Clone from GitHub: git clone https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS.\n  * Install: pip install TTS (use fork like coqui-tts-community if needed, as Coqui\u2019s official repo is archived).\n  * Models available on Hugging Face (e.g., tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/xtts_v2).\n  * Requires GPU for reasonable speed (e.g., NVIDIA 1080 Ti or better).\n* **Cost**:\n  * Hardware only (e.g., \\~$0.10-$0.50/hour on cloud GPU, or free on local hardware).\n  * No per-character costs.\n* **Comparison to Replicate\u2019s XTTS-v2**: Identical model, but you host it, avoiding Replicate\u2019s compute-time pricing.\n\n**2. Tacotron 2 + WaveGlow**\n\n* **Overview**: Open-source TTS pipeline from NVIDIA\u2014Tacotron 2 generates mel-spectrograms, WaveGlow converts to audio.\n* **Functionality**: High-quality, single-language (English) speech synthesis, trainable for custom voices.\n* **Performance**: Near-commercial quality, but slower (\\~5-10 seconds per sentence on GPU) without optimization.\n* **Open-Source Advantage**: Flexible, no vendor lock-in, widely studied.\n* **Setup**:\n  * GitHub: nvidia/tacotron2 and nvidia/waveglow.\n  * Pre-trained models available, or train with your dataset.\n* **Cost**: Hardware-dependent, no usage fees.\n* **Why Consider?**: Proven tech, but less multilingual than XTTS-v2.\n\n**3. VITS (Voicebox)**\n\n* **Overview**: Open-source TTS model combining vocoder and text-to-speech, popular on Hugging Face.\n* **Functionality**: Multilingual, voice cloning, simpler than XTTS-v2.\n* **Performance**: Good quality, faster inference than Tacotron (\\~1-2 seconds/sentence on GPU).\n* **Setup**:\n  * Install via pip install vits or use Hugging Face models (e.g., facebook/vits-vox).\n* **Cost**: Hardware only.\n\n---\n\n**Cost and Infrastructure Considerations**\n\nSince open-source eliminates per-use pricing, costs shift to hardware and maintenance:\n\n* **Local Hardware**:\n  * CPU (e.g., Ryzen 5): Fine for Whisper (slow) or lightweight TTS, \\~$200 one-time.\n  * GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 3060, \\~$300): Ideal for Whisper/XTTS-v2, processes 1-hour audio in minutes or TTS in seconds.\n* **Cloud Hosting**:\n  * AWS/GCP spot instances: \\~$0.10-$0.50/hour for GPU (e.g., g4dn.xlarge).\n  * Free tiers (e.g., Google Colab) for testing, but limited runtime.\n* **Maintenance**: Minimal for pre-trained models; time investment if fine-tuning or scaling.\n\n---\n\n**Comparison to Original APIs**\n\n| **Solution** | **Type** | **Cost** | **Pros** | **Cons** |\n| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |\n| OpenAI Whisper (API) | STT | $0.006/min | Managed, high accuracy | Vendor lock-in, recurring cost |\n| OpenAI TTS (API) | TTS | $0.015/1K chars | Easy, high quality | Vendor lock-in, no customization |\n| Whisper (Self-Hosted) | STT | Hardware only (\\~$0-$0.50/hr) | Accurate, free usage | Slower without GPU, setup effort |\n| XTTS-v2 (Self-Hosted) | TTS | Hardware only (\\~$0-$0.50/hr) | Cloning, multilingual | Latency varies, setup required |\n| DeepSpeech (Self-Hosted) | STT | Hardware only | Lightweight, real-time | Less accurate, English-only |\n| Tacotron 2 (Self-Hosted) | TTS | Hardware only | High quality, trainable | Slower, single-language |\n| VITS (Self-Hosted) | TTS | Hardware only | Fast, multilingual | Less mature than XTTS-v2 |\n\n---\n\n**Recommendations for Low Cost and No Vendor Lock-In**\n\n* **STT**: **Whisper (Self-Hosted)**\n  * Why: Matches OpenAI\u2019s accuracy, widely adopted, and free to use. Optimize with faster-whisper for speed. DeepSpeech is a lighter alternative if real-time matters more than accuracy.\n  * Cost: \\~$300 GPU (one-time) or \\~$0.20/hour on cloud spot instances.\n* **TTS**: **XTTS-v2 (Self-Hosted)**\n  * Why: Best balance of quality, multilingual support, and cloning. Outperforms Tacotron 2 in speed and versatility, and VITS in maturity.\n  * Cost: Same as above\u2014GPU investment or cloud runtime.\n\n**Practical Steps**\n\n1. **Hardware**: Use an existing machine with a GPU or rent a cheap cloud instance (e.g., Paperspace, \\~$0.07/hour with free tier).\n2. **Setup**: Start with Whisper (faster-whisper) for STT and XTTS-v2 for TTS\u2014both are well-documented on GitHub/Hugging Face.\n3. **Scaling**: Batch process audio/text locally or deploy on a server (e.g., Flask app) for programmatic access.\n\nThis approach ensures zero recurring API costs, full ownership, and flexibility to tweak models as needed. If you need help with setup specifics or optimizing for your use case (e.g., real-time vs. batch), let me know!",

            "body": "Let\u2019s compare OpenAI\u2019s Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) APIs with the alternatives you provided\u2014Replicate\u2019s \"Incredibly Fast Whisper\" (STT), Replicate\u2019s \"XTTS-v2\" (TTS), and Deepgram (STT and TTS)\u2014and then explore other potential better alternatives. I\u2019ll include pricing details and evaluate based on performance, features, and cost-effectiveness. Since your question involves both TTS and STT, I\u2019ll split the comparison accordingly.\n\n**OpenAI APIs Overview**\n\n* **STT (Whisper API)**:\n  * **Functionality**: Converts audio to text with high accuracy, supports multilingual transcription (50+ languages with WER < 50%), and can translate to English. Best for pre-recorded audio, not optimized for real-time.\n  * **Performance**: High accuracy (WER \\~8% for English with Whisper v2/v3), but slower processing (10-30 minutes per hour of audio) and computationally intensive.\n  * **Pricing**: $0.006 per minute of audio processed (e.g., $0.36 per hour).\n* **TTS**:\n  * **Functionality**: Converts text to natural-sounding speech with multiple voices (e.g., Alloy, Echo, Fable). Low latency (<1s for short inputs), suitable for real-time use.\n  * **Performance**: High-quality, human-like voices, but limited voice customization compared to some alternatives.\n  * **Pricing**: $0.015 per 1,000 characters (including spaces/punctuation). For example, a 100-word text (\\~500 characters) costs \\~$0.0075.\n\n---\n\n**Replicate\u2019s Incredibly Fast Whisper (STT)**\n\n* **Overview**: A hosted version of OpenAI\u2019s Whisper optimized for speed via Distil-Whisper (a distilled, faster variant) on Replicate\u2019s GPU infrastructure.\n* **Functionality**: Transcribes audio to text, supports Whisper\u2019s multilingual capabilities, but prioritizes speed over absolute accuracy.\n* **Performance**:\n  * Significantly faster than OpenAI\u2019s Whisper API (e.g., 1-hour audio in \\~seconds/minutes vs. 10-30 minutes).\n  * Accuracy slightly lower due to distillation (e.g., WER may increase by 1-2% compared to Whisper v3).\n* **Pricing**:\n  * Replicate charges based on compute time (GPU seconds). For \"Incredibly Fast Whisper,\" costs vary by model size and hardware:\n    * Example: Whisper Large v3 on NVIDIA A100 (40GB) \\~$0.000550/second. A 1-hour audio file processed in \\~60 seconds costs \\~$0.033.\n    * Cheaper hardware (e.g., A40) reduces cost further.\n  * Much cheaper than OpenAI\u2019s $0.36/hour for large volumes, but requires estimating runtime.\n* **Comparison to OpenAI STT**:\n  * **Pros**: Faster, lower cost per minute for batch processing.\n  * **Cons**: Slightly less accurate, no official real-time support, and pricing depends on runtime efficiency.\n\n---\n\n**Replicate\u2019s XTTS-v2 (TTS)**\n\n* **Overview**: An open-source TTS model (Coqui\u2019s XTTS-v2) hosted on Replicate, designed for high-quality, multilingual speech synthesis with voice cloning.\n* **Functionality**: Generates speech from text, supports 17 languages, and can clone voices from a 6-second audio sample.\n* **Performance**:\n  * High-quality, expressive voices with natural prosody.\n  * Latency depends on input length and hardware (e.g., \\~1-3 seconds for short inputs), suitable for real-time with optimization.\n* **Pricing**:\n  * Similar to Replicate\u2019s STT pricing: \\~$0.000550/second on A100 GPU.\n  * Example: A 10-second audio output (\\~100 words) might take 2-3 seconds to generate, costing \\~$0.0011-$0.00165.\n  * Far cheaper than OpenAI\u2019s TTS for short inputs, but scales with compute time.\n* **Comparison to OpenAI TTS**:\n  * **Pros**: Voice cloning, multilingual support, lower cost for small outputs.\n  * **Cons**: Less polished than OpenAI\u2019s voices, latency varies, and requires technical setup for cloning.\n\n---\n\n**Deepgram (STT and TTS)**\n\n* **STT (Nova-2 and Whisper Cloud)**:\n  * **Functionality**: Offers proprietary Nova-2 model (real-time and batch transcription) and a hosted Whisper API. Includes diarization, sentiment analysis, and custom model training.\n  * **Performance**:\n    * Nova-2: 36% more accurate than OpenAI Whisper (WER \\~5-6%), up to 40x faster (seconds per hour of audio), real-time capable (<250ms latency).\n    * Whisper Cloud: Matches OpenAI\u2019s accuracy, but faster and supports larger files (2GB vs. OpenAI\u2019s 25MB).\n  * **Pricing**:\n    * Nova-2: $0.0043/minute at high volume (e.g., $0.258/hour), $0.0059/minute base rate.\n    * Whisper Cloud: $0.003/minute (e.g., $0.18/hour).\n    * $200 free credits for testing.\n* **TTS (Aura)**:\n  * **Functionality**: Generates human-like speech for real-time applications (e.g., voice agents), supports multiple voices.\n  * **Performance**: Latency <250ms, high throughput, natural tone.\n  * **Pricing**: $0.015 per 1,000 characters (same as OpenAI), but optimized for scale.\n* **Comparison to OpenAI**:\n  * **STT Pros**: Faster, cheaper (especially Whisper Cloud), real-time support, more features.\n  * **STT Cons**: Nova-2 focuses on English primarily (though 36+ languages added recently).\n  * **TTS Pros**: Matches OpenAI\u2019s quality, better suited for high-throughput use cases.\n  * **TTS Cons**: Fewer voice options than OpenAI.\n\n---\n\n**Other Better Alternatives**\n\nHere are additional options based on performance, pricing, and features:\n\n**STT Alternatives**\n\n1. **AssemblyAI**:\n   * **Functionality**: Real-time and batch transcription, speaker diarization, sentiment analysis, and LLM integration.\n   * **Performance**: Competitive accuracy (WER \\~7-8%), real-time latency <300ms, excels with noisy audio.\n   * **Pricing**: $0.015/minute base (e.g., $0.90/hour), free tier available (limited usage).\n   * **Why Better?**: More features than OpenAI, real-time support, higher cost reflects added value.\n2. **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text**:\n   * **Functionality**: 125+ languages, real-time streaming, custom models.\n   * **Performance**: WER 16-20% (less accurate than Whisper), 20-30 minutes/hour processing.\n   * **Pricing**: $0.016/minute (e.g., $0.96/hour), first 60 minutes free/month.\n   * **Why Better?**: Broader language support, but less accurate and more expensive.\n\n**TTS Alternatives**\n\n1. **ElevenLabs**:\n   * **Functionality**: Ultra-realistic voices, voice cloning, multilingual (29+ languages).\n   * **Performance**:

Define each table type to ensure consistency and compatibility between Snowflake and StarRocks environments.\n\n**Business Rationale:**  \nEnsuring that table types are accurately mapped and defined between Snowflake and StarRocks is essential for maintaining data integrity, optimizing query performance, and facilitating seamless data integration. This alignment supports efficient data operations and enhances the overall reliability of our analytics infrastructure.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. All table types in the TOKENMETRICS_PROD database are accurately mapped to StarRocks equivalents.\n2. Detailed definitions for each mapped table type are documented.\n3. Mapping and definitions are reviewed and approved by the database architecture team.\n4. Successful testing confirms that the defined table types function correctly within the StarRocks environment.\n5. Any issues identified during mapping are resolved prior to completion.",

Resource Utilization Analysis**\n\n* Collect CPU, memory, and disk usage metrics for **Flink JobManager and TaskManagers**.\n* Identify underutilized or overprovisioned resource requests and limits.\n* Analyze Flink\u2019s job parallelism and checkpointing overhead to optimize resource allocation.\n* Review **heap and off-heap memory usage** for managed state and RocksDB storage.\n\n#### **2. Workload Rightsizing**\n\n* Adjust **Flink JobManager and TaskManager** resource requests & limits.\n* Optimize **parallelism** (`parallelism.default`, `taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots`) to match workload needs.\n* Enable **Reactive Mode** (if applicable) for automatic scaling based on available resources.\n* Tune **heap and managed memory** (`taskmanager.memory.managed.size`, `taskmanager.memory.network.fraction`).\n\n#### **3. Storage & Checkpoint Optimization**\n\n* Assess **Persistent Volume (PV) usage** for Flink state storage (RocksDB or FS-based).\n* Optimize **checkpointing frequency and size** (`state.checkpoints.dir`, `state.backend.rocksdb.memory.managed`).\n* Clean up **stale or unnecessary savepoints** to reduce storage costs.\n* Evaluate **event time vs. processing time checkpointing** to balance cost and recovery speed.\n\n#### **4.

This change aims to decrease data retrieval latency, enhancing the performance of Web & X Agents.\n\n**Business Rationale:**\nReducing data access latency will improve user experience and system efficiency. Transitioning to Supabase is expected to offer faster data processing and lower operational costs compared to Snowflake.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n* All connectors are successfully updated to connect with Supabase instead of Snowflake.\n* Existing queries for HUB table data are migrated and function correctly in Supabase.\n* Latency measurements show a significant decrease in data retrieval times.\n* Collaboration with Andrew is completed, and any dependencies are resolved.\n* No existing functionalities are broken post-migration."

It conducts both synchronous and asynchronous tests to provide a complete performance profile of each service.\n\n## Features\n\n* Synchronous and asynchronous API calls to Cloudflare and OpenAI\n* Stress testing with multiple concurrent requests (10 parallel requests by default)\n* Detailed latency statistics (min, max, mean, median, standard deviation)\n* Results saved to JSON files for further analysis and comparison\n* Simple command-line interface to run different test configurations\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n### Libraries and Dependencies\n\n* **Requests** (v2.31.0): Used for synchronous HTTP calls to the Cloudflare and OpenAI APIs\n* **AIOHTTP** (v3.9.5): Provides asynchronous HTTP client capabilities for parallel processing\n* **OpenAI** (v1.30.0): Official Python library for OpenAI API access\n* **Asyncio** (v3.4.3): Python's built-in asynchronous I/O framework\n* **Python-dotenv** (v1.0.1): For handling environment variables and sensitive API keys\n* **HTTPX**: Used to create custom HTTP clients to avoid proxy configuration issues\n\n### Testing Methodology\n\nThe testing framework employs two distinct approaches:\n\n1. **Synchronous Testing** (`sync_latency_test.py`):\n   * Uses Python's `ThreadPoolExecutor` to make parallel API calls\n   * Each request is executed in a separate thread\n   * Measures end-to-end latency from request initiation to response completion\n2. **Asynchronous Testing** (`async_latency_test.py`):\n   * Uses Python's `asyncio` framework for non-blocking I/O operations\n   * Executes multiple API calls concurrently without thread overhead\n   * Provides a more efficient approach for I/O-bound operations\n\nEach test sends 10 different prompts to each model and calculates comprehensive statistics on the response times, providing insights into real-world performance under load.\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Create a virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv .venv\n   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate\n   ```\n2. Install dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n3. Set up environment variables in `.env` file:\n\n   ```\n   CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_TOKEN=your_cloudflare_auth_token\n   CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=your_cloudflare_account_id\n   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key\n   ```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Run All Tests\n\nThe simplest way to run all tests is to use the main script:\n\n```bash\npython app/main.py\n```\n\nThis will run both synchronous and asynchronous tests for all models.\n\n#### Command Line Options\n\n* `--sync`: Run only synchronous tests\n* `--async-only`: Run only asynchronous tests\n\nExample:\n\n```bash\npython app/main.py --sync        # Run only synchronous tests\npython app/main.py --async-only  # Run only asynchronous tests\n```\n\n### Run Individual Tests\n\nIf you prefer to run tests separately:\n\n#### Run Synchronous Tests\n\n```bash\npython app/sync_latency_test.py\n```\n\n#### Run Asynchronous Tests\n\n```bash\npython app/async_latency_test.py\n```\n\n## Results\n\nResults are saved to the `results` directory in JSON format. Each test run generates a timestamped JSON file with the following information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"timestamp\": \"2023-03-09 12:00:00\",\n  \"num_requests\": 10,\n  \"results\": {\n    \"cloudflare_llama_3_3_70b\": {\n      \"min\": 1.234,\n      \"max\": 5.678,\n      \"mean\": 3.456,\n      \"median\": 3.345,\n      \"stdev\": 0.789,\n      \"num_requests\": 10\n    },\n    \"openai_gpt_4o\": {\n      \"min\": 0.987,\n      \"max\": 4.321,\n      \"mean\": 2.654,\n      \"median\": 2.543,\n      \"stdev\": 0.654,\n      \"num_requests\": 10\n    },\n    \"openai_gpt_4o_mini\": {\n      \"min\": 0.543,\n      \"max\": 3.876,\n      \"mean\": 1.765,\n      \"median\": 1.987,\n      \"stdev\": 0.432,\n      \"num_requests\": 10\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 .env                  # Environment variables for API keys\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md             # Documentation\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt      # Python dependencies\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 app/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py                  # Main entry point\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 sync_latency_test.py     # Synchronous testing implementation\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 async_latency_test.py    # Asynchronous testing implementation\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 utils/\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 cloudflare_client.py           # Synchronous Cloudflare client\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 async_cloudflare_client.py     # Asynchronous Cloudflare client\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 openai_client.py               # Synchronous OpenAI client\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 async_openai_client.py         # Asynchronous OpenAI client\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 results/              # Test result storage directory\n```\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\nThis testing framework measures end-to-end latency, which includes:\n\n1. **Network Request Time**: Time to send the request to the API\n2. **Queue Wait Time**: Time spent waiting in the API provider's queue\n3. **Model Inference Time**: Actual processing time for the AI model\n4. **Network Response Time**: Time to receive the complete response\n\nLatency variations may depend on:\n\n* Geographic location relative to API servers\n* Internet connection quality and bandwidth\n* Current load on the API service\n* Complexity and length of the prompt\n* Time of day (peak vs. off-peak hours)\n\n## Interpreting Results\n\nWhen comparing the test results, consider the following:\n\n* **Asynchronous vs. Synchronous**: Asynchronous tests generally show better overall throughput for multiple requests, but individual request latency may be similar\n* **Mean vs. Median**: The median value often provides a better indication of typical performance since it's less affected by outliers\n* **Standard Deviation**: A lower standard deviation indicates more consistent performance\n* **Min/Max Values**: These show the best and worst-case scenarios you might encounter",

You are responsible for taking this reply/question and formulating a response.\r\n        Use ONLY the relevant data from the sources below to create a tweet in response to the reply/question:\r\n          1. Synthesizes info from all available sources.\r\n          2. Highlights any conflicting signals or diverse perspectives.\r\n          3. Provides specific metrics when available.\r\n          4. Concludes with clear, actionable insight.\r\n\r\n        Follow these rules: \r\n          1. Use only provided data; no external knowledge. \r\n         3. Use TRADER_GRADE_SIGNAL (Strong Buy, Buy, Neutral/Hold, Sell, Strong Sell) to indicate trends (not as investment recommendations). \r\n          4. Do not write Trader Grade percentages explicitly. Convert TRADER_GRADE_SIGNAL percentages to the following trading signals. (not as investment recommendations):\r\n            \u2022 If 80-100% use Strong Buy\r\n            \u2022 If 60-79% use Buy\r\n            \u2022 If 40-59% use Hold\r\n            \u2022 If 20-39% use Sell\r\n            \u2022 If 0-19% use Strong Sell\r\n          5. Do not mention data sources. \r\n          6. Format signals as: 1 = bullish, -1 = bearish. \r\n          7. Do not place token symbols inside parentheses. \r\n          8. When referencing tokens, use either the token name or the token symbol, not both. \r\n          9. Make a punchy, viral-ready tweet. \r\n          10. Don't use any hashtags.\r\n          11. Use $cashtags for token symbols that are 6 characters or less (e.g., $BTC, $ETH). Do not use cashtags for token names, i.e. do not say $BITCOIN or $ETHEREUM.\r\n          12. Separate every sentence with 2 new lines representing a paragraph break, to make the tweets easier to read and more consumable. Return only the tweet content.\r\n          13. Always use Token Metrics (Snowflake) data for the most recent values (price, market cap, FDV, etc.). Don't use price data from X/Twitter or Perplexity, only analysis and info. Don't explicitly write Snowflake in any post, always say \u201cToken Metrics\u201d instead.          \r\n          14. The sentiment of the tweet should match the sentiment of the TRADER_GRADE_SIGNAL. If the signal is Bullish, the sentiment of the tweet should be bullish and optimistic. If bearish, it should be bearish and cautious.\r\n          15.

Adding this column will provide essential information for traders to assess market liquidity and make informed decisions.\n\n**Business Rationale:** Displaying available volume is crucial for traders to evaluate market conditions and execute strategies effectively. Enhancing the dashboard with this information will improve user experience, support data-driven trading decisions, and increase the platform\u2019s value to its users.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. The dashboard includes a new column labeled \"Available Volume.\"\n2. The \"Available Volume\" column accurately reflects real-time volume data from all integrated trading gateways.\n3. Data in the \"Available Volume\" column updates automatically at least every minute.\n4. The addition of the column does not degrade dashboard performance or load times.\n5. Appropriate error handling is implemented to manage data retrieval issues, displaying a default message or indicator when volume data is unavailable."

Identifying Critical Joins for Benchmarking**\n\n* Analyze existing **Snowflake queries** that perform complex joins.\n* Identify high-impact queries based on execution time and frequency.\n* Classify join types (e.g., **hash joins, nested loop joins, broadcast joins**).\n\n#### **2. StarRocks Join Execution Strategies**\n\n* Compare **broadcast joins vs. shuffle joins** in StarRocks.\n* Evaluate how **different join algorithms** impact memory usage and execution speed.\n* Determine **partitioning strategies** for optimal performance.\n\n#### **3. Benchmarking Setup & Resource Allocation**\n\n* Run test workloads in a controlled environment with **varying CPU & memory allocations**.\n* Measure query performance under different **FE (FrontEnd) and BE (BackEnd) node configurations**.\n* Identify the impact of **column pruning, dictionary encoding, and indexing** on joins.\n\n#### **4. Performance Metrics to Capture**\n\n* **Query latency** (before & after migration).\n* **Memory & CPU usage** per query.\n* **Disk I/O and shuffle cost** during joins.\n* **Impact of data skew** on distributed joins.\n\n#### **5. Optimizations & Resource Recommendations**\n\n* Tune **FE/BE node configurations** based on benchmark results.\n* Suggest **indexing strategies** to reduce join overhead.\n* Determine **sufficient memory allocation per query** for stable performance.\n* Recommend optimal **replication and partitioning strategies**.",

This benchmarking will help identify the most efficient query execution plans, partitioning strategies, and indexing techniques required for handling large-scale joins post-migration from **Snowflake**.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Considerations:**\n\n#### **1. Identifying Critical Joins for Benchmarking**\n\n* Analyze existing **Snowflake queries** that perform complex joins.\n* Identify high-impact queries based on execution time and frequency.\n* Classify join types (e.g., **hash joins, nested loop joins, broadcast joins**).\n\n#### **2. StarRocks Join Execution Strategies**\n\n* Compare **broadcast joins vs. shuffle joins** in StarRocks.\n* Evaluate how **different join algorithms** impact memory usage and execution speed.\n* Determine **partitioning strategies** for optimal performance.\n\n#### **3. Benchmarking Setup & Resource Allocation**\n\n* Run test workloads in a controlled environment with **varying CPU & memory allocations**.\n* Measure query performance under different **FE (FrontEnd) and BE (BackEnd) node configurations**.\n* Identify the impact of **column pruning, dictionary encoding, and indexing** on joins.\n\n#### **4. Performance Metrics to Capture**\n\n* **Query latency** (before & after migration).\n* **Memory & CPU usage** per query.\n* **Disk I/O and shuffle cost** during joins.\n* **Impact of data skew** on distributed joins.\n\n#### **5. Optimizations & Resource Recommendations**\n\n* Tune **FE/BE node configurations** based on benchmark results.\n* Suggest **indexing strategies** to reduce join overhead.\n* Determine **sufficient memory allocation per query** for stable performance.\n* Recommend optimal **replication and partitioning strategies**."

User Feedback Model\n\nWe added a new `UserFeedback` model with the following fields:\n\n* `user_id`: Optional user identifier\n* `user_name`: Optional user name\n* `messages`: Complete conversation history at submission time\n* `feedback`: The feedback text from the user\n* `feedback_stage`: Indicator of when feedback was submitted:\n  * `pre_response`: Before receiving an answer\n  * `post_response`: After receiving an answer\n* `timestamp`: When the feedback was submitted\n\n### 2\\. Database Integration\n\n* The feedback is stored in a PostgreSQL database table called `user_feedback`\n* The code includes robust error handling for database connectivity issues\n* If the database is unavailable, the API will still function but will only log feedback locally\n\n### 3\\. Database Setup Script\n\n* Created a separate script to set up and verify the database table\n* The script automatically checks if the table exists and creates it if needed\n* Includes testing functionality to verify write permissions\n\n## Testing\n\n1. **Database Setup**:\n   * Run `python app/db_setup.py` to set up the database table\n2. **API Endpoint**:\n   * The endpoint can be tested using a POST request to `/v2/feedback`\n   * Example payload:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"user_id\": 1234,\n     \"user_name\": \"Test User\",\n     \"messages\": [\n       {\"user\": \"Hello there\"},\n       {\"chatbot\": \"Hello, how can I help you?\"},\n       {\"user\": \"What is Bitcoin?\"}\n     ],\n     \"feedback\": \"The chatbot was very helpful!\",\n     \"feedback_stage\": \"post_response\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. **Database Credentials**:\n   * Credentials are stored in environment variables, not hardcoded\n   * The implementation uses parameterized SQL queries to prevent SQL injection\n2. **Error Handling**:\n   * The API provides appropriate error responses for various failure scenarios\n   * Database errors are not exposed to the client to prevent information leakage\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n1. **Analytics**: Add functionality to analyze feedback trends\n2. **Admin UI**: Create an interface for viewing and managing feedback\n3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Automatically categorize feedback by sentiment (positive/negative)\n\nPR: [https://github.com/token-metrics/tm-ml-chat/compare/production...AI-3598?expand=1](https://github.com/token-metrics/tm-ml-chat/compare/production...AI-3598?expand=1)\ncc: @vasilis @romes @ahmedhamdy ",

the seven category scores, using the following formula:\n\nFinal Score (%) = (Technology Score / 25 \u00d7 25%) + (Tokenomics Score / 20 \u00d7 20%) + (Team Score / 15 \u00d7 15%) + (Market Score / 15 \u00d7 15%) + (Security Score / 10 \u00d7 10%) + (Community Score / 10 \u00d7 10%) + (Maturity Score / 5 \u00d7 5%)\n\n## Grading Scale for Hidden Gem Rankings\n\nBased on the final percentage score, projects can be classified according to this grading scale:\n\n90-100%: S Tier (Exceptional Hidden Gem)\n80-89%: A Tier (Outstanding Potential)\n70-79%: B Tier (Strong Potential)\n60-69%: C Tier (Moderate Potential)\n50-59%: D Tier (Speculative)\nBelow 50%: Not Recommended\n\nThe search results show that the top-rated projects like Plume Network (75.24%), Nexis AI (72.38%), and Flaunch (71.43%) all fall within the B Tier, indicating strong potential as hidden gems1.\n\n## Sector-Specific Adjustments\n\nDifferent cryptocurrency sectors may require specialized evaluation criteria to accurately assess their unique characteristics. The search results demonstrate this need by featuring projects from diverse sectors including RWA, Layer 1, Memecoins, and AI blockchains1.\n\n## Layer 1 & Infrastructure Projects\n\nFor Layer 1 projects like Nexis AI and NesaAI, additional emphasis should be placed on:\n\n* Consensus mechanism efficiency (additional 2 points)\n* Network security model robustness (additional 2 points)\n* Transaction throughput and finality (additional 1 point)\n\n## Real-World Asset (RWA) Projects\n\nRWA projects like Plume Network require evaluation of:\n\n* Asset verification mechanisms (additional 2 points)\n* Legal framework for asset ownership (additional 2 points)\n* Liquidity provisions for tokenized assets (additional 1 point)\n\n## Memecoin & Social Token Projects\n\nFor meme projects like Flaunch and Pumpkin, consider:\n\n* Community virality potential (additional 2 points)\n* Unique cultural relevance (additional 2 points)\n* Trading accessibility and liquidity (additional 1 point)\n\n## AI & ML Integration Projects\n\nAI-focused projects like Nexis AI and NesaAI warrant assessment of:\n\n* Data integrity and quality mechanisms (additional 2 points)\n* AI model effectiveness and verification (additional 2 points)\n* Computational resource optimization (additional 1 point)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis comprehensive scoring system provides a robust framework for evaluating cryptocurrency projects to identify hidden gems with significant potential. By systematically assessing projects across seven critical categories, weighted according to their importance, this rubric offers a balanced and thorough evaluation methodology that can be applied across different cryptocurrency sectors.\n\nThe example projects from the search results demonstrate how this scoring approach can effectively identify promising projects by evaluating their technological innovation, tokenomics, team quality, market potential, security practices, community strength, and development progress. Such a systematic approach helps cut through the noise in the cryptocurrency market to identify projects with genuine potential for success.\n\nFor optimal results, this scoring system should be applied consistently across projects, with appropriate sector-specific adjustments to account for the unique characteristics of different types of cryptocurrency ventures. Regular reassessment is also recommended as projects evolve and market conditions change.\n\n### Citations:\n\n 1.

Specifically:\n\n* The label **\"Market Cap\"** should be changed to **\"Average Market Cap\"**.\n* The label **\"24 Hour Trading Volume\"** should be updated to **\"24H Trading Volume\"**.\n* Additionally, the **sorting** on the **Index Details** page does not match the **Figma design**.\n* [https://jam.dev/c/bfb584fd-4491-4574-9be2-4fde719c93c1](https://jam.dev/c/bfb584fd-4491-4574-9be2-4fde719c93c1)\n\n## Title3: Default Selection in Index Performance Chart Should Be \"Max\" Instead of \"1Y\"\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Index Performance Chart**, the default selection is currently set to **1Y**. However, according to the **Figma design**, the default selection should be **Max** instead. This inconsistency affects the user experience, as the chart initially shows the wrong time range.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/af384c5a-7e5a-4aa6-ad85-82e2ab67c3fc](https://jam.dev/c/af384c5a-7e5a-4aa6-ad85-82e2ab67c3fc)"

Currently, these sections scroll away with the page, which makes it difficult for users to refer to them while exploring other content on the page.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/e8517a01-b45f-4513-bd9b-9e9f0127648b](https://jam.dev/c/e8517a01-b45f-4513-bd9b-9e9f0127648b)\n\n## Title4: There is no tooltip for Index Selection\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/3938fa3a-ad2b-49e2-82ac-e0f2cabd64ab](https://jam.dev/c/3938fa3a-ad2b-49e2-82ac-e0f2cabd64ab).

We need to verify if the **Token Count** should always be 10 for each index, or if this is an issue with how the data is being retrieved or displayed.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/a2a0f35b-8ea8-40a9-9499-402b0e4fbe54](https://jam.dev/c/a2a0f35b-8ea8-40a9-9499-402b0e4fbe54)\n\n## Title7: Data Units and Clarity Missing in Indices Price History Chart\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Indices Price History** chart, the displayed data is unclear, and it is not specified which **unit** the data is in (e.g., price, percentage, or other metrics). Additionally, it's uncertain if the data display format is correct.

This issue is likely due to layout changes or misalignment of the button on the page.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/359601f4-ba55-4284-b989-78cfe21d7d19](https://jam.dev/c/359601f4-ba55-4284-b989-78cfe21d7d19)\n\n## Title9: Default Selection in Index Performance Chart Should Be \"Max\" Instead of \"1Y\"\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Index Performance Chart**, the default selection is currently set to **1Y**.

This results in incomplete data for certain coins, which could confuse users or prevent them from making informed decisions.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/d4e02caf-9972-4eb7-a78b-35a9a2479208](https://jam.dev/c/d4e02caf-9972-4eb7-a78b-35a9a2479208)\n\n## **Title2:** Inconsistent Design for \"Search Tokens\" and \"Search Indices\" Search Buttons\n\n**Description:**\nThe designs for the **\"Search Tokens\"** and **\"Search Indices\"** search buttons are different These buttons should have a consistent design to ensure a unified user experience and improve the overall UI consistency.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/30b1de19-d8e1-47ae-ab59-f91886d39bd4](https://jam.dev/c/30b1de19-d8e1-47ae-ab59-f91886d39bd4)\n\n## **Title3:** \"Investor Index\" and \"Price Performance\" Sections Should Be Fixed on Scroll\n\n**Description:**\nThe **\"Investor Index\"** and **\"Price Performance\"** sections on the left side of the page should remain **fixed** when scrolling down. Currently, these sections scroll away with the page, which makes it difficult for users to refer to them while exploring other content on the page.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/e8517a01-b45f-4513-bd9b-9e9f0127648b](https://jam.dev/c/e8517a01-b45f-4513-bd9b-9e9f0127648b)\n\n## Title4: There is no tooltip for Index Selection\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/3938fa3a-ad2b-49e2-82ac-e0f2cabd64ab](https://jam.dev/c/3938fa3a-ad2b-49e2-82ac-e0f2cabd64ab). Could you send the tooltip detail?\n\n## Title5: Sorting Not Available for \"Top Gainer\" Column in All Indices Table\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **All Indices** table, the **\"Top Gainer\"** column does not have sorting functionality, and users cannot sort the data in this column. We need to evaluate whether sorting is necessary for this column or if the current behavior is appropriate. @ayo Do we need to sort Top Gainer?\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/ab2018b5-b5a3-4c4f-91f3-4dadf50389d5](https://jam.dev/c/ab2018b5-b5a3-4c4f-91f3-4dadf50389d5)\n\n## Title6: Token Count Showing 10 for All Indices\n\n**Description:**\nThe **Token Count** for all indices is displayed as **10**, but it is unclear whether this is the correct number for every index. We need to verify if the **Token Count** should always be 10 for each index, or if this is an issue with how the data is being retrieved or displayed.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/a2a0f35b-8ea8-40a9-9499-402b0e4fbe54](https://jam.dev/c/a2a0f35b-8ea8-40a9-9499-402b0e4fbe54)\n\n## Title7: Data Units and Clarity Missing in Indices Price History Chart\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Indices Price History** chart, the displayed data is unclear, and it is not specified which **unit** the data is in (e.g., price, percentage, or other metrics). Additionally, it's uncertain if the data display format is correct. This makes it difficult for users to interpret the chart accurately. @ayo \n\n[https://jam.dev/c/7afe878c-622d-44b2-851b-e769835397d5](https://jam.dev/c/7afe878c-622d-44b2-851b-e769835397d5)\n\n## **Title8:** \"Buy Token\" Button Unclickable Due to Layout Shift\n\n**Description:**\nThe **\"Buy Token\"** button is not clickable because its position shifts unexpectedly, preventing users from interacting with it. This issue is likely due to layout changes or misalignment of the button on the page.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/359601f4-ba55-4284-b989-78cfe21d7d19](https://jam.dev/c/359601f4-ba55-4284-b989-78cfe21d7d19)\n\n## Title9: Default Selection in Index Performance Chart Should Be \"Max\" Instead of \"1Y\"\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Index Performance Chart**, the default selection is currently set to **1Y**. However, according to the **Figma design**, the default selection should be **Max** instead. This inconsistency affects the user experience, as the chart initially shows the wrong time range.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/af384c5a-7e5a-4aa6-ad85-82e2ab67c3fc](https://jam.dev/c/af384c5a-7e5a-4aa6-ad85-82e2ab67c3fc)"

This could be due to a data retrieval issue or an incorrect filter being applied, limiting the number of holdings displayed.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/88beca17-80c4-4b2b-984e-684e67f6ee1e](https://jam.dev/c/88beca17-80c4-4b2b-984e-684e67f6ee1e)\n\n## **Title5:** \"Top Trending Indices\" Showing Negative Percentage as Green Instead of Red\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Top Trending Indices** section, negative percentages are displayed in **green** instead of **red**, which is misleading. Negative values should be displayed in red to indicate a loss or decline, but currently, they are incorrectly shown in green.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/c56670b1-d3ab-4e8f-bae6-636cb067c121](https://jam.dev/c/c56670b1-d3ab-4e8f-bae6-636cb067c121)\n\n## **Title6:** Market Cap Field Missing for Some Coins in **Index Holdings**\n\n**Description:**\nThe **Market Cap** data is missing for some coins in the cryptocurrency section.

The space does not seem intentional and creates a visually unappealing gap between the content and the pop-in.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/0105fd79-428f-4f29-a76f-a7e10f4bff06](https://jam.dev/c/0105fd79-428f-4f29-a76f-a7e10f4bff06)\n\n## Title8: Token icon on tree map not properly formatted\n\n#### **Description:**\n\nThe token icons on the **tree map** are not properly formatted, leading to visual inconsistencies.

This issue prevents users from viewing additional information that should be displayed in the tooltips.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/081f311a-f023-43eb-bbb4-a6becd1c2bbb](https://jam.dev/c/081f311a-f023-43eb-bbb4-a6becd1c2bbb)\n\n## Title2: 404 Error When Clicking \"Top Trending Indices\"\n\n**Description:**\nWhen clicking on the **\"Top Trending Indices\"** button, a **404 error** is returned, indicating that the requested page or resource is not found. This prevents users from accessing the trending indices data.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/8f92b439-7ea1-42df-9774-16e9df0348de](https://jam.dev/c/8f92b439-7ea1-42df-9774-16e9df0348de)\n\n## Title3: 0% Displayed for 10 Tokens in Cryptocurrency Section\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Cryptocurrency** section, 10 tokens are displayed, but their respective values are shown as **0%**. This issue could cause confusion, as it appears that the tokens have no value or change in percentage, even though they are being displayed.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/7d13659a-187d-4525-9e5c-55a8cc129727](https://jam.dev/c/7d13659a-187d-4525-9e5c-55a8cc129727)\n\n## **Title4:** Only 2 Index Holdings Visible in Dog-Themed Index Holdings Section\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Dog-Themed Index Holdings** section, only **2 index holdings** are visible, even though there should be more listed. This could be due to a data retrieval issue or an incorrect filter being applied, limiting the number of holdings displayed.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/88beca17-80c4-4b2b-984e-684e67f6ee1e](https://jam.dev/c/88beca17-80c4-4b2b-984e-684e67f6ee1e)\n\n## **Title5:** \"Top Trending Indices\" Showing Negative Percentage as Green Instead of Red\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Top Trending Indices** section, negative percentages are displayed in **green** instead of **red**, which is misleading. Negative values should be displayed in red to indicate a loss or decline, but currently, they are incorrectly shown in green.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/c56670b1-d3ab-4e8f-bae6-636cb067c121](https://jam.dev/c/c56670b1-d3ab-4e8f-bae6-636cb067c121)\n\n## **Title6:** Market Cap Field Missing for Some Coins in **Index Holdings**\n\n**Description:**\nThe **Market Cap** data is missing for some coins in the cryptocurrency section. This results in incomplete data for certain coins, which could confuse users or prevent them from making informed decisions.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/cf9ca2de-bb59-4f00-a248-1ebb6d4e6f74](https://jam.dev/c/cf9ca2de-bb59-4f00-a248-1ebb6d4e6f74)\n\n## **Title7:** Unnecessary Space Above Exchange Pop-in\n\n**Description:**\nThere is an **unnecessary space** above the **Exchange pop-in** on the page, which affects the layout and user experience. The space does not seem intentional and creates a visually unappealing gap between the content and the pop-in.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/0105fd79-428f-4f29-a76f-a7e10f4bff06](https://jam.dev/c/0105fd79-428f-4f29-a76f-a7e10f4bff06)\n\n## Title8: Token icon on tree map not properly formatted\n\n#### **Description:**\n\nThe token icons on the **tree map** are not properly formatted, leading to visual inconsistencies. This affects the overall readability and usability of the visualization.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/1c99c2eb-919a-41a4-abf3-a5170ec19ff6](https://jam.dev/c/1c99c2eb-919a-41a4-abf3-a5170ec19ff6)"

The video covers metrics usage, the cause of the spike, when the spike happened and what we have done to ensure it doesnt happen again.\n\nIn the meantime, I've set up Grafana locally in our cluster. You can access it at:\n\n* [http://34.121.160.20/](http://34.121.160.20/)\n* **i have** setup our Kubernetes dashboards\n\nI'm currently working on migrating our existing cloud dashboards to this local instance.\n\n## Options We're Considering\n\n1. **Grafana Cloud**:\n   * Current cost concerns discussed in the video\n   * Implemented mitigation steps to optimize spending\n   * We currently use Grafana Cloud K6 for load testing, which is an important component of our testing strategy\n2. **Locally Hosted**:\n   * Recently deployed at 34.121.160.20\n   * Potential for cost savings compared to cloud option\n   * Would require additional infrastructure management\n\nLet me know your thoughts on which direction we should take. The key consideration is balancing the functionality we need (especially K6 for load testing) against our budget constraints.",

However, if the token exists on multiple chains, the **Swap Widget** on the Token Details Page defaults to displaying the token on its most popular chain, which can be confusing.\n\nTo improve user experience, we need to **pass the chain name** from the **Ratings Page** to the **Token Details Page** via the backend, ensuring that if a user selects a token on a particular chain, the corresponding Token Details Page reflects the **same chain** in the swap widget.\n\n[Page 1 - Token Chain Display Logic - Token Details Pagee (Swaps) (Figma)](https://www.figma.com/board/T1NZ1zO6Izf095HEChDP1Y/Token-Chain-Display-Logic---Token-Details-Pagee-(Swaps)?node-id=0-1&t=mqjcubC2i9yXobrS-1)\n\n#### **Requirements & Implementation Details**\n\n1. **Single Chain Filter**\n   * If the user filters the **Ratings Page** by **one** chain and clicks on a token, the **Token Details Page** must display the token on the same chain in the **Swap Widget**.\n   * The **chain name** should be passed from the Ratings Page to the Token Details Page in the request.\n2. **Multiple Chains Filter**\n   * If the user filters the Ratings Page by **multiple chains**, there is no way to determine the user's intended chain selection.\n   * In this case, the **Swap Widget** should default to displaying the token on its **most popular chain**, as determined by the **LiFi provider**.\n\n#### **Expected Behavior**\n\n* The **Token Details Page** should reflect the chain from which the token was selected on the **Ratings Page** (if only one chain was filtered).\n* If multiple chains were filtered, the Swap Widget should default to the **most popular chain**.\n\n#### **Impact**\n\n* Ensures consistency between the Ratings Page and the Token Details Page.\n* Reduces confusion when swapping tokens across multiple chains.\n* Improves user experience by maintaining chain preference where applicable.",

However, if the token exists on multiple chains, the **Swap Widget** on the Token Details Page defaults to displaying the token on its most popular chain, which can be confusing.\n\nTo improve user experience, we need to **pass the chain name** from the **Ratings Page** to the **Token Details Page** via the backend, ensuring that if a user selects a token on a particular chain, the corresponding Token Details Page reflects the **same chain** in the swap widget.\n\n[Page 1 - Token Chain Display Logic - Token Details Pagee (Swaps) (Figma)](https://www.figma.com/board/T1NZ1zO6Izf095HEChDP1Y/Token-Chain-Display-Logic---Token-Details-Pagee-(Swaps)?node-id=0-1&t=mqjcubC2i9yXobrS-1)\n\n#### **Requirements & Implementation Details**\n\n1. **Single Chain Filter**\n   * If the user filters the **Ratings Page** by **one** chain and clicks on a token, the **Token Details Page** must display the token on the same chain in the **Swap Widget**.\n   * The **chain name** should be passed from the Ratings Page to the Token Details Page in the request.\n2. **Multiple Chains Filter**\n   * If the user filters the Ratings Page by **multiple chains**, there is no way to determine the user's intended chain selection.\n   * In this case, the **Swap Widget** should default to displaying the token on its **most popular chain**, as determined by the **LiFi provider**.\n\n#### **Expected Behavior**\n\n* The **Token Details Page** should reflect the chain from which the token was selected on the **Ratings Page** (if only one chain was filtered).\n* If multiple chains were filtered, the Swap Widget should default to the **most popular chain**.\n\n#### **Impact**\n\n* Ensures consistency between the Ratings Page and the Token Details Page.\n* Reduces confusion when swapping tokens across multiple chains.\n* Improves user experience by maintaining chain preference where applicable."

Here\u2019s why:\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 **1. Different Gas Fee Estimations**\n\n* **Li.Fi Widget** uses **aggregated data from multiple liquidity sources** to estimate gas fees.\n* **MetaMask** calculates gas fees **based on Ethereum network conditions** at that moment.\n* **Network congestion** can cause discrepancies between the two.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 **2. Slippage and Route Differences**\n\n* **Li.Fi Widget** optimizes swaps across multiple DEXs and bridges, each with its own fees.\n* **MetaMask** may use a different routing system (e.g., Uniswap, 1inch) with different liquidity pools.\n* Slippage settings in **Li.Fi** might differ from what **MetaMask** applies.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 **3. Protocol Fees and Spreads**\n\n* **Li.Fi Widget** may add a small fee for its services, depending on the route selected.\n* **MetaMask Swaps** charge their own **service fee (0.875%)**, which might not be visible until the final transaction.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 **4. Bridge & Network Costs**\n\n* If you are bridging assets, **Li.Fi Widget** includes **bridge fees** that MetaMask doesn\u2019t account for.\n* MetaMask usually only considers **network gas fees** for transactions, not bridge service fees.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 **5. Real-Time Price Updates**\n\n* **Li.Fi Widget** dynamically updates swap prices based on liquidity, which may **refresh more slowly** than MetaMask.\n* If there\u2019s **high volatility**, the estimated swap cost can change quickly.",

This functionality should provide a seamless flow for initiating and completing swaps without leaving the treemap interface.\n\n**Business Rationale:**\nEnhancing the treemap chart with swap capabilities will improve user experience by simplifying the trading process. This streamlined approach can increase user engagement and trading activity by making it easier and more efficient for users to exchange tokens within the platform.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. A \"Buy token\" option is available for each token displayed in the treemap chart on the token details page on hover.\n2. Selecting \"Buy token\" opens a swap widget where users can choose the target token and specify the amount to trade.\n3. The swap process integrates with the existing trading backend and completes transactions accurately.\n4. Users receive a confirmation message upon successful completion of a swap.\n5. The swap feature aligns with the design specifications outlined in the [Figma task](https://www.figma.com/design/74Zz1grTtdFlkydLSZe3q7/TMAI_task?node-id=7925-64586&t=XnB1WXk45XYAX0Vm-4).\n6.

This functionality should provide a seamless flow for initiating and completing swaps without leaving the treemap interface.\n\n**Business Rationale:**\nEnhancing the treemap chart with swap capabilities will improve user experience by simplifying the trading process. This streamlined approach can increase user engagement and trading activity by making it easier and more efficient for users to exchange tokens within the platform.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. A \"Buy token\" option is available for each token displayed in the treemap chart on the token details page on hover.\n2. Selecting \"Buy token\" opens a swap widget where users can choose the target token and specify the amount to trade.\n3. The swap process integrates with the existing trading backend and completes transactions accurately.\n4. Users receive a confirmation message upon successful completion of a swap.\n5. The swap feature aligns with the design specifications outlined in the [Figma task](https://www.figma.com/design/74Zz1grTtdFlkydLSZe3q7/TMAI_task?node-id=7925-64586&t=XnB1WXk45XYAX0Vm-4).\n6. The feature is fully tested and functions correctly across all supported browsers and devices."

One specific improvement we've already discussed is switching from react-icons to l`ucide-icons` (referenced in the issue. [ENG-4647](https://linear.app/token-metrics/issue/ENG-4647/review-the-local-development-experience-for-tm-30) ). We should continue ao analyse ur dependency tree to find other optimisation opportunities.\n\nA**rchitecture Evolution**: As our application and team continue to grow, we might want to explore approaches like Micro-Frontends or Next.js Multi-zones ([https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/multi-zones](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/multi-zones)). This would complement our existing microservices backend architecture and help with team scalability and deployment independence.\n\nThese observations are preliminary based on challenges I've faced while working with the codebase. I think we should have further team discussions to evaluate the impact and feasibility of these approaches before making major architectural decisions.",

This allocation has demonstrated a noticeable performance gain, improving build times from `6:33` to `5:39`, resulting in a time gain of 54 seconds (approximately 14.5%).\n2. **Baseline Machine Consideration**:\n   * When evaluating the performance of our code base, a baseline machine configuration should ideally be similar to the Mac M2 with 24GB RAM. This configuration provides a reasonable balance between performance and resource availability, ensuring that our code runs effectively without hitting memory constraints.\n3. **Library Changes and Optimization**:\n   * While changing libraries can lead to potential performance gains (e.g., removing React-Icons returned a 35% faster build time), it is crucial to maintain a bare minimum machine specification. Even with optimization efforts, operating on lower-spec systems (e.g., machines with only 12GB of RAM) could lead to build instability and increased build times.\n4. **Comparative Gains**:\n   * The various approaches we are considering include:\n     * **Library Removal**: Approx. 35% faster builds by eliminating unnecessary dependencies.\n     * **Code Optimization**: Streamlined code can further enhance performance, but exact gains depend on the specific changes made.\n     * **EC2 High-RAM Allocation**: 14.5% faster builds observed with maximum RAM allocation, which shows that moving to a stronger infrastructure can yield significant time savings.\n     * **Maintaining Minimum Specifications**: Keeping a machine like the M2 (24GB) as the baseline helps to ensure reliable performance across all environments.\n\nIn summary, each approach has its own benefits that we need to consider in relation to our performance goals. Utilizing an EC2 instance with robust configurations can be a practical solution, especially if we can't allocate similar machines locally. Connecting to EC2 servers from our local setup offers a quick and efficient way to leverage better resources. However, it\u2019s still important to maintain a minimum specification baseline to ensure stable performance. As we work on optimizing our code and libraries, this balance will help us achieve better operational efficiency.\n\nCC @suleman @ian ",

Tree-shaking ensures only the icons you import end up in the final build, cutting out unused code\u2014a must for performance.\n\n1. **Tabler Icons** npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tabler/icons-react | GitHub: https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons | Website: https://tabler-icons.io/\n   * **Why it\u2019s great**: Over 2,000 clean, modern SVG icons as individual React components. Tree-shaking is built-in, so importing IconHome only bundles that icon. It\u2019s lightweight and consistently fast\u2014think 6-13 seconds for thousands of icons in a modern bundler like Vite or Webpack.\n   * **Setup**: npm install @tabler/icons-react, then import { IconHome } from '@tabler/icons-react';.\n   * **Best for**: Teams wanting a balance of variety and speed without extra config.\n2. **Feather Icons** (npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-feather | GitHub: https://github.com/feathericons/react-feather | Website: https://feathericons.com/)\n   * **Why it\u2019s great**: Super lightweight with 287 minimalistic SVG icons. Like Tabler, it\u2019s tree-shakeable by default\u2014only the icons you import (e.g., import { Home } from 'react-feather';) make it into the build. Its small size means even quicker compiles than larger libraries.\n   * **Setup**: npm install react-feather.\n   * **Best for**: Projects needing a smaller, curated set of icons with minimal overhead.\n3. **Heroicons** (npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@heroicons/react | GitHub: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/heroicons | Website: https://heroicons.com/)\n   * **Why it\u2019s great**: Offers \\~450 icons in two styles (outline and solid), optimized for React with tree-shaking. Maintained by the Tailwind Labs team, it\u2019s a solid choice if you\u2019re already in that ecosystem. Build times stay snappy since unused icons are stripped out.\n   * **Setup**: npm install @heroicons/react, then import { HomeIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/solid';.\n   * **Best for**: Tailwind users or teams wanting polished icons with moderate variety.\n4. **Phosphor Icons** (npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/phosphor-react | GitHub: https://github.com/phosphor-icons/phosphor-react | Website: https://phosphoricons.com/)\n   * **Why it\u2019s great**: A hefty 6,000+ icons with multiple weights (thin, regular, bold, etc.), all tree-shakeable. It\u2019s more extensive than Tabler but still keeps builds efficient by only including what you use. Slightly heavier than Feather or Heroicons, but versatile.\n   * **Setup**: npm install phosphor-react, then import { House } from 'phosphor-react';.\n   * **Best for**: Projects needing a huge icon range without sacrificing build performance.\n\nCompared to **react-icons**, which bundles multiple icon sets and can bloat builds even with tree-shaking (due to its size and less granular imports), these options are purpose-built for efficiency. **Tabler** or **Feather** are my top picks for speed-focused teams\u2014Tabler if you need more icons, Feather if you can work with fewer. Test one in your project with your bundler (Vite, Webpack, etc.) and check the build stats. \n\ncc: @suleman @yogendra ",

Regarding the analyzer we already did that and found out `react-icons` and some charting libraries are taking some space that we can remove or replace. \n\nThe main issue here is even if these libraries are present they just consume some space maybe a few MBs in final build bundle, then why during processing of the build it consumes this much memory when final bundle size is nowhere near 8-12GB? This means during the actual build it does something specific which consumes alot of memory. It's like processing a video which is 100MB in size itself but processing it in an editing software takes 12GB of RAM.\n\nThough I want to initially go for an option of removing the `react-icons` library and then trying to build again to see how much memory consumption difference we see. The issue is this library is used in around 181 files within our repo, so even commenting it out for testing would take a lot of time. I tried with AI tools as well but due to context size being too big they also fail and start doing strange stuff after editing 10-20 files. If you have bandwidth you can try it and we can discuss the impact of that, if we see improvements then we'll focus on removing it entirely and using `lucide-react` which is already present or some other library which is smaller in size. Then we can proceed with charting libraries and do the same thing.\n\nWhat's your suggestion/opinion on this?",

While GitHub peer reviews are valuable, they often focus on smaller code segments. This expanded process involves:\n\n1. **Full-Project Audits**: Each developer examines the entire codebase, not just isolated PRs.\n2. **Hands-On Testing**: Reviewers clone the repository, run the project in a **staging environment**, and actively **test functionality** to identify hidden issues.\n3. **Cross-Team Involvement**: Team members outside the immediate project also join in, providing fresh perspectives and \u201ctearing it apart\u201d to find potential weaknesses.\n4. **Knowledge Sharing**: As everyone reviews the code, they gain a deeper understanding of the project\u2019s architecture and dependencies, strengthening overall team expertise.\n5. **Mandatory Checkpoint**: Before release, ensure that each developer\u2019s feedback has been addressed, documented, and signed off in **Linear** or the relevant project management tool.\n\nImplementing this **full-project peer review** ensures higher code quality, reduces bugs in production, and encourages a culture of shared ownership and continuous learning."
