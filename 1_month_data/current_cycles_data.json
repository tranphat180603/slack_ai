Chain Configuration (chain_config.py)\n\n- [X] Create ChainConfig class with RPC prefix, chain ID, name, and currency\n- [X] Implement chain configuration dictionary for supported networks:\n  - Mainnet: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, zkSync, Avalanche, Fantom\n  - Testnet: Sepolia, Goerli, Mumbai, Arbitrum Goerli, Optimism Goerli, Base Goerli\n- [X] Add helper functions for RPC URL construction\n- [X] Implement chain validation and error handling\n\n### 2\\. Token Transfer Analysis (transaction_analyzer.py)\n\n- [X] Implement Web3 connection setup with Alchemy\n- [X] Add ERC20 transfer event detection and parsing\n- [X] Extract transfer information:\n  - From/To addresses\n  - Token amount with proper decimal handling\n  - Raw transfer value\n- [X] Categorize transfers (incoming/outgoing)\n- [X] Add error handling for failed contract calls\n\n### 3\\. Token Information Retrieval\n\n- [X] Implement ERC20 contract interaction\n- [X] Fetch token metadata:\n  - Token name\n  - Token symbol\n  - Decimals\n- [X] Handle unknown tokens gracefully\n- [X] Add proper error handling for contract calls\n\n### 4\\. Price Tracking Integration\n\n- [X] Implement Coingecko API integration\n- [X] Add chain-to-platform ID mapping\n- [X] Fetch current token prices in USD\n- [X] Calculate total transfer value in USD\n- [X] Handle missing price data gracefully\n\n### 5\\. Output Formatting\n\n- [X] Structure transfer information display\n- [X] Format token information section:\n  * Name, Symbol, Decimals\n  * Contract address\n  * Current price in USD\n- [X] Format transfer details section:\n  * From/To addresses\n  * Amount with symbol\n  * USD value\n  * Raw amount\n\n## Pending Enhancements\n\n- [ ] Add historical price data at time of transaction\n- [ ] Add gas cost analysis\n- [ ] Implement caching for token metadata and prices\n- [ ] Add support for custom RPC endpoints\n- [ ] Create CLI interface for better usability\n- [ ] Add transaction summary statistics\n- [ ] Add unit tests and documentation\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* web3==6.15.1\n* python-dotenv==1.0.1\n* requests==2.31.0\n\n## Environment Requirements\n\n* Python 3.7+\n* Alchemy API key\n* Internet connection for Web3 and Coingecko API\n\n## Usage Example\n\n```python\nchain = 'optimism'\naddress = '0x45D4778a5ad57fa9d102aD47005757fE7640fb45'\ntx_hash = '0xf9c134919d52c474e98aff653a0bb120392210f6c0e976d7e23b5c0f016faddd'\nresults = analyze_transfer_events(chain, address, tx_hash)\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n* Coingecko API is rate-limited for free tier\n* Some tokens might not have price data available\n* USD values shown are based on current prices, not historical\n* Token contract calls might fail for non-standard implementations",

      "description": "## Scorecard : [Berachain Scorecard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1riwAwGz33G1GsGaI_LWDWm3hFKP9ezLKsJjft_0-tao/edit?gid=0#gid=0)\n\n## Notes\n\n* Berachain is a high-performance [EVM-Identical](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/#berachain-evm-identical-%E2%9F%A0) Layer 1 blockchain utilizing [Proof-of-Liquidity](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/#proof-of-liquidity-%F0%9F%A4%9D) (PoL) and built on top of the modular EVM-focused consensus client framework [BeaconKit](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/#beaconkit-%E2%9B%B5%E2%9C%A8).\n* Berachain's execution layer is identical to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) runtime environment seen on Ethereum Mainnet. This means that it uses existing unmodified [execution clients](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/help/glossary#execution-client) like Geth, Reth, Erigon, Nethermind, and more to handle executing smart contracts and supports all the tooling that comes native with the EVM.\n* Identical means that whenever the EVM is upgraded, Berachain can adopt the latest version\u2014for example, Dencun\u2014straight out of the box. This includes compatibility with all RPC namespaces and endpoints, and any improvements made to execution clients can be applied immediately to Berachain.\n* Proof-of-Liquidity\u00a0\n  * Proof-of-Liquidity radically changes the way L1 economics are structured, prioritizing users and applications over validator rewards at baseline. Network incentives go towards enriching ecosystem liquidity, contributing to efficient trading, price stability, securing the chain, and increasing network/user growth.\n  * Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) is a novel economic mechanism that uses network incentives to align the interests of ecosystem participants and bolster both application-layer and chain security.\n  * Berachain's consensus borrows from the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model and contains two key components:\n    * [$BERA](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/tokens/bera) - Validators secure the chain by staking the native gas token\n    * [$BGT](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/tokens/bgt) - A soulbound governance token distributed by validators for proposing new blocks, which is ultimately rewarded to users who provide ecosystem liquidity (see [Reward Vaults](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/rewardvaults))\n  * A validator's $BGT emissions increase with the amount of $BGT delegated to them. Protocol-provided [Incentives](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/incentives) are received for these emissions, and validators pass these to their delegators after collecting a commission.\n  * \u00a0Proof-of-Liquidity separates the token responsible for gas and security from the token used to govern chain rewards and economic incentives.\n  * \n* BeaconKit is a modular framework developed by Berachain for building EVM [consensus clients](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/help/glossary#consensus-client). It integrates the benefits of CometBFT consensus, including increased composability, [single slot finality (SSF)](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/single-slot-finality/), and more.\n  * BeaconKit is a modular [consensus layer](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/help/glossary#consensus-client) that is adaptable for Ethereum-based blockchains.\n  * Running a BeaconKit-based chain provides several advantages (assuming the default configuration of pairing with an EVM execution client):\n    * Single slot finality (compared to Ethereum's \\~13 minutes)\n    * Optimistic payload building (executing block proposal in parallel with voting) reduces block times by up to 40%\n    * Conformity to Eth2 modularity\n    * Full EIP compatibility\n* Security Layer ($BERA)\n  * Berachain's Active Set of validators (validators participating in consensus) is determined by validators' $BERA stake, with a minimum of 250,000 $BERA and a maximum cap of 10,000,000 $BERA.\u00a0\n  * The top 69 validators ranked by stake are in the Active Set.\u00a0\n  * Within the Active Set, a validator's probability of proposing a block is proportional to their staked $BERA \u2014 more $BERA staked increases the likelihood of proposing a block.\n* Reward Layer ($BGT)\n  * The size of a validator's $BGT block reward is determined by their Boost, which is a percentage calculated from the validator's $BGT boost divided by the total $BGT boosted to all validators. Boosts are obtained when $BGT holders delegate to validators.\n  * For each block proposed, the validator receives both a base emission and a variable reward emission based on their boost percentage\n  * After collecting the base $BGT rewards for themselves, validators direct the remaining variable $BGT rewards to whitelisted [Reward Vaults](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/rewardvaults) of their choosing (\u2463). In exchange for directing their emissions, validators receive protocol-provided [Incentives](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/incentives) from Reward Vaults (the $BGT is earned by users supplying liquidity to the protocol).\n  * Protocols creating Reward Vaults must additionally [whitelist their vaults](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/governance/rewardvault) through $BGT governance to be eligible to receive emissions from validators.\n* Reward Vaults\n  * Reward Vaults are smart contracts in which users can stake their Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) eligible assets to receive $BGT rewards. Reward Vaults are the only way anyone can earn $BGT rewards, and therefore serve the important function of gating entry into the PoL ecosystem.\n* Ecosystem Alignment \ud83e\udd1d\n  * By integrating Berachain's native network rewards among all ecosystem participants, PoL creates alignment between:\n\n\n* Validators: Need $BGT delegation to maximize their block rewards and must efficiently direct emissions to reward vaults to earn Incentives and attract more boost.\n* Protocols: Compete for $BGT emissions by offering attractive Incentive rates in their reward vaults\n* Users: Earn $BGT by providing liquidity, then delegate to validators who maximize returns\n\n\n* Berachain Tokenomics\n  * $BERA serves as the native gas and staking token of Berachain, the first blockchain powered by Proof-of-Liquidity, while $BGT facilitates governance and economic incentives.\n  * Users who are boosting validators with their $BGT earn a share of Berachain core dApp fees, namely fees from BEX and HoneySwap. This is done via the [FeeCollector](https://docs.berachain.com/developers/contracts/fee-collector) contract.\n  * $HONEY is Berachain's native stablecoin, designed to provide a stable and reliable means of exchange within the Berachain ecosystem and beyond. $HONEY is fully collateralized and soft-pegged to the US Dollar.\n* Native dapps\n  * BeraHub is the place to manage all things $BGT and access Berachain liquidity through BEX.\n  * Berachain's native decentralized exchange (DEX), BEX, allows trading of any arbitrary pair of crypto assets via swapping and providing liquidity into [liquidity pools](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/help/glossary#liquidity-pool).\n  * Honey Swap allows users to trade approved stables and assets for [$HONEY](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/tokens/honey).\n  * [BeraScan Block Explorer](https://berascan.com/)\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdwtSVM02JDIIKyrbRaz1xK9vYMEwKCgucXBduYI6vZuQZrhW3Acm4w3Ot4f7Q4Y_RyBcoooQevBEqu1WxOzRAtFiv6syrc1DElqdVI9JWDwgqyfGrzS9nX_AkM89CfsRIhpCqPqQ?key=0wJFrmhJn5x8MfCVVceZMoMm)\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcE1fHwWxuL4JgG9uGHoMauVth_JbAZA2PpWfJT0dNN2ir2D_L9J-Q9Yku5eQCPqBPIsuxh7K2hGXe2alH3BvZ6-zxCYHlkDmqCm0Xjc4_O-oQYf7ZCnICcGmUq2HwatbQ2AVLjig?key=0wJFrmhJn5x8MfCVVceZMoMm)",

We want to be the best at recognizing user and agent intent for any Web3 interaction.\n* Execute transactions, search resources and retrieve onchain data by prompting in natural language.\n* We believe in a future where every onchain interaction starts from a simple prompt to make web3 accessible to everyone.\n* The [Brian API](https://docs.brianknows.org/brian-api/apis) and [Brian TS SDK](https://docs.brianknows.org/brian-sdk/brian-typescript-sdk) allow developers to integrate the Brian AI capabilities in their applications to build intent-based apps that could be custodial, non-custodial, or support smart accounts.\n* The [LangChain<>Brian SDK](https://docs.brianknows.org/ai-agents/langchain-less-than-greater-than-brian-sdk) allows devs to launch LangChain AI Agents capable of transacting and deploying tokens on-chain.\n* The [Brian App](https://www.brianknows.org/), built on top of Brian APIs, offers users an interface for performing transactions in a non-custodial way, researching web3 info, and deploying smart contracts by prompt.\n* Brian API is an Intent Recognition and Execution Engine capable of understanding the user intent for Web3 interactions, providing accurate textual answers and data, building transactions, or generating smart contracts.\n* Prompt to Earn\n  * prompt on the Brian App, and earn Brian points.\n  * The Prompt-To-Earn program is your unique chance to contribute to our dataset of TX-intents. By collecting the user's prompts, we'll be able to create a dataset of TX-intents and Instruct Fine-Tune (IFT) the open-weight domain-specific model for web3\n* Intent Recognition Engine\n  * can power the next generation of autonomous Agents and intent-based apps for users.\u00a0\n  * The Brian architecture (Fig. 1), which represents the end-to-end flow of our API, can be split into two components:\n    * The Intent Recognition Engine: the component that receives the textual input and, via the Brian AI models, understands what the user/agent intent is.\n    * The Intent Execution Engine: the component that builds the API output via a series of existing off-chain tools and, for TXs, on-chain aggregators/solvers in the market.\n* Brian AI models\n  * The Brian-8B model, built on top of Llama-3.1-8B, is an LLM tailored for the Web3 space. This model shows excellent capabilities in natural language understanding of technical sentences related to the web3 world.\n  * Such a model is well suited for developers and startups because its size makes it easily deployable and faster at inference. This is our first step to showcase the utility of having web3-related models and the Brian team's objectives towards contributing to the community.\u00a0\n  * Brian-8B acts as a backbone model, which means it is not suited to be released in production since this is only the first phase of a longer process that will take another few months\n  * By leveraging the unique dataset (e.g., intents for transactions, QA for info/data, Solidity code) that the Brian team owns, several IFT models covering a wide range of web3-related use cases will be released:\n    * Natural-language to JSON model\n    * Solidity code generation model\n    * QA model\n* Brian App is the first application built on the Brian API. You can:\n  * [Ask Brian](https://docs.brianknows.org/brian-app/ask-brian): ask for information about supported protocols and chains. Brian will generate a response and indicate the resources used to generate it. Such as \"What is Swarm?\"\n  * [Send Transaction](https://docs.brianknows.org/brian-app/send-transactions): build the transaction for the user by simply prompting in English.\n  * [Deploy Smart Contracts](https://docs.brianknows.org/brian-app/deploy-smart-contracts): Here you can ask Brian to write, compile, deploy a smart contract for you by simply prompting in English\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcHE5FPf1G8HN3ldWAg8yCnwO069AVo_vhfLFMNOqRSbedLitpWXIdBuyV1-zEwzUmOC0ANWXPHpUNVfmid6VhaqTMai6XCaqsM4vkny_2_7Nc-KnEmTjPEPSIb3UEvcMUh99sfWA?key=JS3d2aTrNDpvMRIJ184jep8a)",

      "description": "ROVR - 67.14%\n\nScorecard: [ROVR - FR Scoresheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HL6wuRFcY_r29xqEpHqUev9FWfZmLu8OONOSsVFNMac/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## Introduction:\n\n* Decentralized HD mapping & 3D data platform for autonomous driving and spatial AI\n* Powered by Geodnet\n* Built on Solana\n* ROVR is a decentralized, global platform for high-definition, all-scenario, real-time 3D data collection, processing, and storage.\n\n## Solution:\n\n* ROVR is a decentralized global platform designed for high-definition, real-time 3D data collection, processing, and storage across all scenarios. We are driven by the belief that data ownership should rest with individual producers, not large corporations or organizations. By generating vast volumes of ultra-high-definition 3D and 4D data\u2014complete with detailed timelines\u2014ROVR is establishing a robust foundation for the next generation of 3D AI training.\n* ROVR is a highly transparent and autonomous project, where any organization or individual can produce, sell, or even DIY their hardware devices within the open-source framework of the ROVR project. They can also participate in data collection, storage, maintenance, and processing, and can join or leave the ROVR network at any time.\n* The ROVR community plays a crucial role throughout the entire ROVR network. It consists of members from various roles such as data contributors, data consumers, developers, DIY enthusiasts, hardware manufacturers, and computing platform providers. Together, they ensure the healthy operation of the ROVR network.\n\n## Innovation:\n\n* The ROVR ecosystem operates through a multi-layered structure, with its foundation rooted in the DePIN layer. Data contributors leverage ROVR hardware to collect 3D data from open environments. This raw data is processed by professional data processing companies into highly commercialized data products. These refined datasets are then utilized by data consumers in fields such as intelligent driving and spatial AI training. Building on the DePIN layer, a 1:1 mirrored metaverse will be developed, where real-world data assets are fully tokenized, enabling seamless value exchange and interoperability.\n\n* ROVR will fully adopt onboard RTK (Real-time Kinematic) and PPK (Post-processed Kinematic) systems, supplemented by AGNSS and integrated navigation, to consistently improve the overall system positioning accuracy to the centimeter level.\n* ROVR will employ automotive-grade mass-produced multi-channel solid-state 3-dimensional LiDAR and onboard survey-grade IMU systems. In the collected raw data, approximately 1 million laser reflection points with an accuracy within 2 cm are generated per second to describe the surrounding scene and for 3D reconstruction.\n\n## Use Case / Features:\n\n* Drive, Explore, and Earn Tokens on the Go\n* **\"TarantulaX Mini\"** is a highly integrated and compact sensor system, including an enhanced RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) positioning unit, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and a Web3 identity and data validation module. It connects to smartphones via Bluetooth. It utilizes the smartphone's camera to capture road images, process and classify the data, and upload it, thereby earning $ROVR tokens.\n* The **\u201cLightCone\u201d** is a professional device equipped with a multi-channel lidar (>120 channels, 200 meters measurement range), capable of directly sensing the surrounding 3-dimensional environment in real-time. It also integrates automotive-grade integrated navigation systems and large-aperture (>130mm) measurement antennas. The device integrates 4G/5G networks to automatically collect, process, and upload data, earning $ROVR tokens, as well.\n* It's worth noting that whether it's the \u201cTarantula Mini\u201d or the \u201cLightCone\u201d, the user device's speed must be between 15 km/h and 140 km/h. Rewards will not be generated if the speed exceeds or falls below this range. The reward is related to the number of kilometers of quality data.\n* **R-Node** serves as the data storage and processing node for the ROVR network. Users can provide nodes that meet the requirements of hardware, software, and network conditions, and stake $ROVR tokens to earn $ROVR token rewards, including basic rewards and additional workload rewards.\n\n## Traction:\n\n## Tokenomics:\n\n* $ROVR is the token of ROVR Network in the future. Contributors can earn $ROVR rewards by using ROVR devices (TarantulaX, LightCone) to collect data, or provide data storage nodes, or by staking on storage nodes.\n* Anyone contributing to the ROVR network, whether through data collection or other means, will receive very fair token rewards. These tokens are distributed based on actual workload and cost input. In other words, it's a return to proof-of-work (POW), but with a more meaningful and environmentally friendly approach, capable of generating significant social and economic value.\n* ROVR Reward Points are designed for contributors to the ROVR project. Before the official token issuance ($ROVR), data collection contributors will be recorded and receive points as rewards. During the TGE (Token Generation Event), these reward points will be converted into $ROVR tokens at a certain ratio (ideally 1:1 or a similar rate, depending on user growth and external/internal factors at the time of TGE) and distributed as airdrops.\n* For future data consumers purchasing ROVR data services, the ROVR Foundation will use the received fiat currency or stablecoins to buy back $ROVR on the secondary market, and then burn 100% of it.\n\n## Roadmap:\n\n* \n\n## Business Model:\n\n* ROVR Inc. is responsible for cleansing, processing, and ultimately transforming the data within the ROVR network into HD maps and other data products, which are then sold to end customers.\n* ROVR Inc. can provide customized maps or other data services according to the requirements of OEM/Tier 1 or other clients.\n* When the time is right, similar to hardware development and production, ROVR will open up third-party data processing. Any organization or individual will be able to perform secondary processing on ROVR data and sell it to end users. This will be an important component of the ROVR ecosystem.\n\n## Go-To-Market:\n\n* \n\n## Investors:\n\n* Outlier Ventures - 1\n* Borderless - 2\n* **Iotex - 9**\n\n## Community:\n\n* 5.5k on X\n* 1.4k on Discord\u00a0\n* 13 on LinkedIn\n\n## Competition:\u00a0\n\n* \n\n## Team:\u00a0\n\n* ",

      "description": "Stork - 65.71%\n\nScorecard: [Stork - FR Scoresheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kftzMP77iwmM6SlDvEBeb0asnwK1v1XJZQcRqq-qXwI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## Introduction:\n\n* Stork Network is a Web3 oracle provider focused on delivering highly accurate and reliable data feeds for decentralized applications (dApps).\n* Stork is an oracle protocol that enables ultra low latency connections between data providers and both on and off-chain applications. The most common use-case for Stork is pulling and consuming market data in the form of real time price feeds for DeFi.\n\n## Solution:\n\n* The platform enhances the quality of on-chain data to minimize risks associated with decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain-based services.\n* Stork Network aims to improve the security and efficiency of these applications by offering precise data essential for their operation.\n\n## Innovation:\n\nThe core technical principles of Stork are:\n\n* Modularity\n* Low latency / high throughput\n* Cost efficiency\n* Arbitrary data support\n* Transparency, verifiability, and security\n\n## Use Case / Features:\n\n* Stork\u2019s Open Data Market unlocks access to decentralized, reliable, and unique data, empowering you to build your vision without compromise.\n* Stork is implemented as a pull oracle. Stork continuously aggregates, verifies, and audits data from trusted publishers, and makes that aggregated data available at sub-second latency and frequency. This data can then be pulled into any on or off-chain application as often as needed.\n\n**Products:**\n\n* **Stork for Real Time:** Stork for Real Time is an ultra low-latency, decentralized off and on-chain price feed designed for any chain. Stork for Real Time is powered by a decentralized network of data publishers, and signed with a cross-chain compatible signature.\u00a0 Stork for Real Time prioritizes performance, using ultra-fast websockets to ensure data is available at the millisecond level, similar to the data used for trading in TradFi.\n* **Stork for Options:** Stork for Options is a just-in-time derivative oracle. Queried via REST API, derivatives such as\n  * Implied Volatility\n  * Underlying Futures Prices\n\namong others are calculated upon API request based on Storks real time prices.\n\n* **Stork for StarkEx:** Stork maintains a first class partnership with StarkEx. This enables Stork to provide oracle services that are accepted natively by StarkEx. The key difference between Stork for Real Time and Stork for StarkEx is that the signatures used are compatible with StarkEx, and present only in the publisher messages.\n* **Composite Oracle Service:** A Composite Oracle Service (COS) allows for modular and configurable custom Aggregators enabled by Storks core architecture.\n\n## Traction:\n\n* Stork currently supports 370+ assets on 60+ chains, including EVM chains, Solana, Sui, Aptos, and more, and is easily deployed on any other chain not yet supported.\n\n## Tokenomics:\n\n* \n\n## Roadmap:\n\n* \n\n## Business Model:\n\n* \n\n## Go-To-Market:\n\n* Partners: Vertex, Sui, OKX, TON, Ostium\u00a0\n\n## Investors:\n\n* $4M Seed in August 2024 from\n  * Faction - 0\n  * **CMS Holdings - 1**\n  * **Wintermute - 1**\n  * **Lattice - 7**\n\n## Community:\n\n* 26.8k on X\n* 51k on Discord\u00a0\n\n## Competition:\u00a0\n\n* \n\n## Team:\u00a0\n\n* ",

      "description": "Intuition - 65.71%\n\nScorecard: [Intuition - FR Scoresheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XyQkKWA8jZOWZdJqWl3z7v7U6WDony8obvJoiL1Q-mQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## Introduction:\n\n* Intuition is a semantic context layer and data discovery engine for the next evolution of the internet, enabling the intuitive cooperation of biological and artificial intelligence at scale.\n* Intuition is building a powerful and versatile ecosystem of apps and developer tooling on top of the world\u2019s first open and semantic knowledge graph.\n* This new data layer makes it easy for anyone to capture and curate verifiable social wisdom free from the limitations of application specific silos.\n\n## Solution:\n\n* Intuition provides decentralized infrastructure, developer tools, and applications enabling the creation of an open, flexible knowledge graph enhancing the quality and availability of social knowledge.\n* Intuition lets users create attestations about any subject, storing the information in such a way that it's easily navigable, queryable, and leveraged by other applications.\n* Intuition's protocol and middleware allow developers to easily integrate the company's attestations and knowledge graph into their own applications.\n\n* **Own your data\u2014and get paid:** Intuition breaks down data into discrete, ownable units\u2014allowing for the establishment of programmatic value flows that disintermediate the value capture of the 'oil of the internet'.\n* **Discover Portable Self-Sovereign Identifiers:** Globally unique and persistent decentralized identifiers for all things\u2014not just people\u2014allowing for the universal referencing of all entities, concepts, and data across the Web.\n* **Leverage Collaborative Innovation:** A unified, collectively-owned semantic mapping of the world's data, allowing developers to push and pull data from a single location rather than needing to integrate with thousands of disparate APIs.\n* **Standards Through Incentive Alignment:** Facilitating collaborative, flexible categorization of data through incentive alignment and intuition rather than rigid taxonomies. Don\u2019t waste your time in standards hell - discover emergent, bottom-up structures forged by social consensus.\n\n## Innovation:\n\n* Intuition is a decentralized **token-curated graph (TCG)** of linked verifiable data that enables people and machines to get the data and information they need, when they need it, from the sources they trust.\n* By leveraging cryptoeconomics and a Web of Trust to standardize how identities and data are structured, shared, verified, captured, and discovered, Intuition creates a unified layer of globally-persistent contextual information for the Web\u2014laying the foundation for the next era of digital interactions.\n\n**Meet the primitives: A new paradigm in data capture, storage, and interoperability.**\n\n* **Atoms: Tokenized decentralized identifiers for everything\u2014from entities, to concepts, to arbitrary data.**\n* **Triples:** Tokenized statements, composed of Atoms, in RDF/Semantic Triple format.\n* **Signal:** The weighted state of each Atom and Triple in the knowledge graph, representing 'who is attesting to what'.\n\n## Use Case / Features:\n\n**\u200dA Holistic Trust Stack**\n\n* While trustless code helps to minimize the need for intermediaries, Web3 is far from fully trustless\u2014remaining inherently reliant on people and social consensus.\n* Intuition leverages the latest in trustless technologies to build trustful systems\u2014where users and machines interact, transact, and decision-make with confidence through technologically-mediated intuition.\n\n**A Communal Data Commons**\n\n* Intuition\u2019s design fosters non-linear growth in information aggregation, where each new contribution disproportionately increases the value of the network.\n* By providing the rails for data tokenization, ownership, monetization, and standardization, Intuition unlocks the full potential of the internet: a maximally-interoperable, level playing field\u2014where data is not monopolized, but rather treated as a communal resource to be shared.\n\nA flexible and open system for capturing and curating the world's data:\n\n**Features:**\n\n* **Canonical Identifiers: Introducing unique, persistent, canonical decentralized identifiers for all things - not just people.**\n* **Traversable Attestations: Many-to-one attestations that are uniquely structured to make verifiable data eminently more discoverable and usable.**\n* **Data Neutrality Framework: Open, transparent standards fostering an ecosystem where data and services can interact without barriers or bias, promoting innovation, competition, fairness, and truth.**\n* **Decentralized Knowledge Graph: A semantic mapping of the world's data, allowing for deterministic querying and discoverability\u2014disrupting the status-quo of platform-specific silos.**\n* **Tokenized Incentives: Rewards for creating and curating useful information and data standards/structures, encouraging engagement and enhancing the quality of the system.**\n\n## Traction:\n\n## Tokenomics:\n\n* \n\n## Roadmap:\n\n* \n\n## Business Model:\n\n**Fees & Rewards:**\n\nEvery interaction with the knowledge graph action in Intuition comes with a small fee, similar to gas fees in blockchain systems. Users pay a fee when interacting with or creating data in order to gain partial ownership of that data. These fees go towards:\n\n* **Rewarding Prior Contributors:** Part of the fee is distributed to all existing owners (prior contributors). This encourages early, meaningful contributions, as users who add valuable data will continue to be rewarded over time as more people engage with that data.\n* **Protocol Fees:** A small portion of the fee goes to the Intuition treasury for future platform improvements. Ultimately, this treasury will be community owned and managed.\n\n## Go-To-Market:\n\n* 40+ projects are integrated with or building with Intuition\u00a0\n* Detailed ecosystem: [https://www.intuition.systems/ecosystem](https://www.intuition.systems/ecosystem)\n\n## Investors:\n\n* $4M Seed in June 2023 from\n  * **Superscrypt - 1**\n  * **ConsenSys - 9**\n  * Shima Capital - 0\n  * **GSR - 8**\n  * P2 Ventures - 0\n  * The DAO\n  * Orange DAO - 0\n  * **ArkStream Capital - 1**\n  * Avon Ventures\u00a0\n  * **Matrixport Ventures - 1**\n  * Polymorphic Capital - 0 and others\u00a0\n\n## Community:\n\n* 49k on X\n* 1.8k on Hey\n* 44.5k on Discord\u00a0\n* 428 on LinkedIn\n* 179 on Medium\u00a0\n* 26k on Telegram\n* 1.1k on Farcaster\n\n## Competition:\u00a0\n\n* \n\n## Team:\u00a0\n\n* ",

      "description": "## 1\\. Overview\n\nThis ticket details the design and implementation plan for a referral-based rewards system integrated into our existing payment processing contract (TMAIPayment) for the tokenmetrics platform. The system is built to incentivize users to refer new customers by offering a percentage-based referral fee. It ensures robust security, gas efficiency, and upgradeability, using proven patterns and libraries.\n\n---\n\n## 2\\. Objectives\n\n* **Incentivize Referrals:** Encourage users to refer others by awarding them a fee based on payments made.\n* **Seamless Integration:** Integrate with the existing payment contract to process payments and log referrals.\n* **Gas Efficiency:** Optimize data storage and processing to reduce gas costs.\n* **Security:** Leverage upgradeable contracts and strict access controls to protect funds.\n* **Upgradeability:** Use OpenZeppelin\u2019s upgradeable contracts to allow future improvements.\n\n---\n\n## 3\\. System Requirements\n\n1. **Referral Fee Calculation:**\n   * The backend signs messages that include a referral fee percentage (expressed in basis points, e.g., 500 for 5%).\n   * The payment contract calculates the referral fee from the payment amount.\n2. **Single Referral per Payment:**\n   * Only one referral is allowed per payment. If the referral field is absent (i.e., referrer is the zero address), no referral reward is processed.\n3. **Immediate Record Removal:**\n   * Referral records must be removed immediately after a successful withdrawal to minimize gas consumption for future withdrawals.\n4. **Upgradeability:**\n   * Both the Payment and Referral contracts should be upgradeable using OpenZeppelin\u2019s upgradeable patterns.\n5. **Restricted Access:**\n   * The referral contract is callable only by the payment contract, ensuring that only valid payment-triggered referrals are logged.\n6. **Token Consistency:**\n   * The payment and referral fees use the same ERC20 token.\n7. **Withdrawal Delay:**\n   * A configurable delay (e.g., one week) must elapse before a referrer can withdraw their accumulated rewards.\n\n---\n\n## 4\\. System Architecture\n\n### 4.1 Components\n\n* **Payment Contract (TMAIPayment):**\n  * Processes payments for subscriptions.\n  * Verifies backend signatures that now include referral data.\n  * Calculates referral fees and forwards them to the Referral contract.\n  * Manages subscription creation and upgrades via a Soulbound NFT contract.\n* **Referral Contract (ReferralRewards):**\n  * Receives referral fee amounts from the Payment contract.\n  * Logs referral events with fee amount and timestamp.\n  * Enforces a withdrawal delay before allowing referrers to claim their rewards.\n  * Processes withdrawals and immediately cleans up processed records to optimize future operations.\n\n### 4.2 Integration Flow\n\n1. **Extended Payment Signature:**\n   * The backend produces a signature message containing standard payment data (user address, token, amount, nonce, etc.) and new fields:\n     * `referrer` (address): The address of the referrer.\n     * `referralFeePercentage` (uint256): The fee percentage (in basis points) to be applied on the payment amount.\n2. **Payment Contract Processing:**\n   * **Verification:** Validates the signature, nonce, and token eligibility.\n   * **Token Transfer:** Transfers the payment amount from the user.\n   * **Referral Fee Calculation:** If a valid `referrer` is provided, calculates the fee:\n\n     ```\n     feeAmount = (tokenAmount * referralFeePercentage) / 10000;\n     ```\n3. * **Referral Logging:** Transfers the calculated fee to the Referral contract and logs the referral event using the Payment contract's current nonce as a unique identifier.\n   * **Subscription Management:** Calls the appropriate functions on the Soulbound NFT contract to create or upgrade the subscription.\n   * **Nonce Increment:** Increments the user's nonce to prevent replay attacks.\n4. **Referral Contract Processing:**\n   * **Logging Referral:** The Referral contract\u2019s `logReferral` function (restricted to the Payment contract) records the referral with fee amount and the current timestamp.\n   * **Withdrawal Functionality:** When a referrer initiates a withdrawal:\n     * The contract iterates over the referrer\u2019s recorded referrals.\n     * Only records where `block.timestamp >= record.timestamp + withdrawalDelay` are eligible.\n     * Aggregates the eligible fees, transfers them to the referrer, and removes those records immediately (using an efficient swap-and-pop method).\n\n---\n\n## 5\\. Data Structures\n\n### 5.1 Payment Message (Backend-Signed)\n\n```\nstruct PaymentMessage {\n    address userAddress;            // Payer\u2019s address\n    address token;                  // ERC20 token address for payment\n    uint256 tokenAmount;            // Payment amount\n    uint256 nonce;                  // Transaction count for replay protection\n    uint8 product;                  // Subscription product identifier\n    uint8 planType;                 // Type of subscription plan\n    uint256 expiryDate;             // Subscription expiry timestamp\n    address referrer;               // (Optional) Referrer\u2019s address\n    uint256 referralFeePercentage;  // (Optional) Fee percentage in basis points\n}\n```\n\n### 5.2 Referral Record (ReferralRewards Contract)\n\n```\nstruct ReferralRecord {\n    uint256 feeAmount; // Referral reward amount in token's smallest unit\n    uint256 timestamp; // Block time when the referral was recorded\n}\n```\n\n### 5.3 Mappings\n\n* **Referral Records:**\n\n  ```\n  mapping(address => ReferralRecord[]) public referrals;\n  ```\n\n      This maps each referrer to their list of referral records.\n\n---\n\n## 6\\. Key Functions & Flow\n\n### 6.1 In Payment Contract\n\n* **processPayment(signature, isUpgrade):**\n  * Verifies the signed `PaymentMessage`.\n  * Transfers tokens and processes subscription logic.\n  * If `referrer` is provided:\n    * Calculates referral fee.\n    * Transfers fee to the Referral contract.\n    * Calls `logReferral` on the Referral contract.\n  * Increments the user's nonce.\n* **updateReferralContract(address):**\n  * Allows the contract owner to set or update the Referral contract address.\n\n### 6.2 In Referral Contract\n\n* **initialize(paymentContract, withdrawalDelay):**\n  * Sets the Payment contract address and the withdrawal delay.\n* **logReferral(referrer, feeAmount, paymentId):**\n  * Restricted to calls from the Payment contract.\n  * Records a new referral event with the fee amount and the current block timestamp.\n  * Emits a `ReferralLogged` event.\n* **withdrawReferralFees(token):**\n  * Allows referrers to withdraw accumulated fees.\n  * Iterates through the referral records; if the delay has passed, aggregates the fee.\n  * Transfers the total eligible amount to the referrer.\n  * Immediately removes the processed referral records.\n  * Emits a `ReferralWithdrawn` event.\n\n---\n\n## 7\\. Security Considerations\n\n* **Access Control:**\n  * The Referral contract\u2019s logging function uses an `onlyPaymentContract` modifier to ensure that only the Payment contract can call it.\n* **Nonce Management:**\n  * The Payment contract maintains a nonce per user to prevent replay attacks.\n* **Safe Token Transfers:**\n  * Both contracts utilize `SafeERC20Upgradeable` for secure token transfers.\n* **Withdrawal Delay Enforcement:**\n  * The enforced delay before withdrawal minimizes risks related to rapid fund extraction and flash loan exploits.\n* **Data Cleanup:**\n  * Immediate removal of referral records upon withdrawal prevents future gas-intensive iterations.\n\n---\n\n## 8\\. Gas Optimization Strategies\n\n* **Efficient Data Storage:**\n  * Using arrays with swap-and-pop removal for referral records minimizes storage costs and iteration overhead.\n* **Limited Iteration:**\n  * The withdrawal function iterates only over a referrer\u2019s records, and records are removed as soon as they are processed.\n* **Off-Chain Calculations:**\n  * The referral fee percentage is provided by the backend, reducing on-chain computational overhead.\n\n---\n\n## 9\\. Upgradeability\n\n* **Upgradeable Contracts:**\n  * Both contracts are built with OpenZeppelin\u2019s upgradeable patterns (using `Initializable` and `OwnableUpgradeable`), allowing for future enhancements without disrupting current functionality.\n* **Separation of Concerns:**\n  * The clear separation between payment processing and referral logging ensures that upgrades in one module do not inadvertently affect the other.\n\n---\n\n## 10\\. Conclusion\n\nThis design document presents a detailed plan for integrating a referral rewards system into the existing payment contract. The design meets all specified requirements:\n\n* It computes referral fees based on backend-provided percentages.\n* It processes a single referral per payment.\n* It enforces a withdrawal delay and cleans up referral records immediately upon withdrawal.\n* It ensures that both contracts are upgradeable and secure, with the referral contract callable only by the Payment contract.\n* The approach optimizes gas usage while maintaining robust security practices.\n\nThis ticket serves as a blueprint for the implementation phase. Please review and let me know if you have any questions, require further details, or need adjustments to meet additional project requirements.",

      "description": "## Notes\n\n* The Monad protocol delivers full EVM compatibility with breakthrough performance, true decentralization, production-grade security, and exceptional throughput.\n* The L1 Blockchain with Limitless Potential\n* 100% EVM-Compatible\n* 10,000 Transactions per second\n* Near zero gas fees\n* 0.5 Second block times\n* 1s Single-slot finality\n* MonadDB allows you to store most of the state on SSD instead of RAM. This significantly reduces RAM requirements and reduces the cost of running a node\u2014 creating a clear path to scalable decentralization.\n* Monad is a redesign of both the consensus and execution systems of Ethereum that preserves compatibility for EVM smart contracts and Ethereum\u2019s RPC API.\n* Optimistic Parallel Execution\n  * Monad employs optimistic parallel execution, executing transactions in parallel before previous ones are completed\u2060. Results are committed in the original order and checked against the current state to ensure accuracy.\n  * Efficiently processes blockchain transactions by executing them in parallel using multiple virtual machines, predicting dependencies to optimize scheduling, and merging results sequentially to ensure correct execution order while maximizing resource utilization.\n* A custom database for storing blockchain state, using Patricia Trie data structure, both on-disk and in-memory\u2014 reducing hardware requirements.\n* Asynchronous Execution\n  * Execution is decoupled from consensus, allowing single-shard blockchain to scale to millions of users. Execution begins on a block after consensus completes, running in parallel to the next block\u2019s consensus.\n  * In Monad, nodes come to consensus (i.e. agreement about the official ordering of transactions), without ever executing those transactions.\n  * \n* MonadBFT\n  * A custom BFT mechanism derived from HotStuff, optimized to reduce communication phases from three to two, enhancing efficiency. Its optimistically responsive design allows rounds to progress at actual network latency, improving performance.\n  * MonadBFT operates under the assumptions of partial synchrony and a maximum 33% Byzantine stake weight.\n  * A high-performance POS consensus mechanism with 1s block times on MonadDB.\n  * \n* MonadDB\n  * MonadDb is a critical component in Monad for maintaining full Ethereum compatibility while delivering high performance. It is a custom-built key-value database designed for storing authenticated blockchain data.\n  * A custom state database that significantly enhances blockchain performance by optimizing storage and access of Merkle Patricia Trie data, enabling high-performance parallel access crucial for Monad's parallel execution capabilities.\n  * MonadDB allows you to keep most of the state on SSD instead of RAM\u2014 reducing RAM requirements, costs and allowing consumer-grade hardware to participate in the network.\n* the Monad Foundation, an independent organization dedicated to encouraging the development and adoption of the Monad blockchain protocol.\u00a0\n  * The Foundation\u2019s principal activity will be to facilitate validator-led governance and community-led improvement proposals; provide developer documentation relating to the network; and engage in ecosystem development, marketing, and advisory-related services for the Monad protocol.",

Core features of the platform include:\n  * Global Decentralized Identifiers: Introducing unique, persistent, canonical identifiers for all things - not just people.\n  * Traversable Attestations: Many-to-one attestations that are uniquely structured to make verifiable data eminently more discoverable and usable.\n  * Data Neutrality Framework: Open, transparent standards fostering an ecosystem where data and services can interact without barriers or bias, promoting innovation, competition, fairness, and truth.\n  * Universal Knowledge Graph: An open, permissionless data lake accessible by all, disrupting the status-quo of application-specific silos.\n  * Information Markets: Rewards for creating and curating useful information interacted with by others, facilitating engagement and enhancing quality.\n* Intuition\u2019s open social knowledge graph is built to harness collective wisdom in a structured, permissionless, and fully decentralized manner. The system\u2019s resulting state is open and accessible to everyone, enabling limitless use cases and expanding the information available about the countless entities we engage with daily\u2014whether it\u2019s a pseudonym, a smart contract, an organization, or a piece of content. This approach empowers users with a richer understanding of the ecosystem and facilitates more informed interactions.\n* The Intuition system leverages a combination of on and off chain interactions to create, store, and manage data within the Intuition knowledge graph in the following ways:\n* The Trust Protocol\n  * The Intuition protocol provides the infrastructure for a new information economy, using cryptoeconomic incentives to promote the expression of high-quality, semantic data. Specifically, the protocol is designed to promote:\n    * the creation of useful data\n    * convergence on universal canonical identifiers for all things\n    * convergence on data standards, schemas, and formats\n* Services\n  * Indexing: The Indexing layer of Intuition seamlessly integrates both on-chain and off-chain data into a unified, semantic knowledge graph. This structured framework provides developers with access to a rich, context-aware dataset that transcends traditional data silos, allowing for a web-wide view that enhances the depth and precision of applications built on the protocol.\u00a0\n  * Data Access: Intuition\u2019s Trust Graph is designed for maximum accessibility and usability by applications. The Data Access layer allows developers to stream real-time data from the knowledge graph to the database best suited for their use case.\n* Modules\n  * App Development\n    * Intuition\u2019s initial flagship application, The Portal, allows users to create, navigate, aggregate, and curate attestations regarding people and things within the web3 ecosystem, a space where qualitative reputation and identity data is acutely lacking. Leveraging users\u2019 social graphs (i.e., the people and organizations they \u201cfollow\u201d) and distributed trust algorithms (e.g., EigenTrust), the application will be able to prioritize the display of relevant activity and tailor attestation weighting.\n    * Other in-house applications include a Browser Extension, MetaMask Snap, Mobile App, and Data Populator - each serving its own unique function in demonstrating the power of the Intuition System.\n  * SDK\n    * Intuition offers templates, component libraries, and pre-built integrations to significantly reduce development complexity. Removing much of the integration work allows developers to focus on innovating, achieve faster deployments, and ensure a high-quality user experience.",

Individuals can contribute data and earn rewards, while developers gain access to a rich, ethically sourced dataset for building innovative AI applications, anywhere. This open-source, permissionless network tackles the issue of data exploitation by compensating individuals for their contributions. Masa's unique staking model ensures network stability and fosters a self-learning, evolving ecosystem for equitable participation.  Join our mission to create a fairer, more democratic AI landscape powered by the people.\n\n\n# Features\n\nMasa is building the world's largest decentralized personal data network. Since launching in August 2022, the network has amassed over 1.2 million unique wallets contributing 23 million proprietary data points. Masa empowers every internet user to seamlessly own, share, and earn from their data, even without a web3 wallet.  Our goal is to encompass over 50% of all web3 users' personal data within the next three years.\n\nPrivacy is paramount. Masa has pioneered Zero-Knowledge Soulbound Tokens (zkSBTs), an industry-leading encryption technology ensuring users' personally identifiable information remains private when shared in the data market and with developers.  These innovations were even featured at the 2023 7th Cyber Security in Networking Conference (CSNet).\n\nWe're also powering the future of AI and data applications. Over 70 leading web3 businesses, including zkSync, QuickSwap, Injective, and Celo, are early adopters of Masa's products.  With the rapid growth of AI models, Masa leads the way in supplying vast amounts of privacy-first personal training data, fueling the next generation of AI applications.\n\n\n# Business Model\n\nMasa's innovative business model empowers both individuals and businesses within the decentralized data economy.  Individuals can earn $MASA tokens by contributing their verified data, directly benefiting from the value they create.  Developers and businesses, on the other hand, gain access to a rich, ethically sourced, and privacy-preserved data stream to fuel their AI applications.  This two-sided marketplace fosters a fair and sustainable ecosystem where data ownership and monetization are placed directly in the hands of the users.\n\n\n# Traction\n\nAt the time of the Coinlist sale, Masa boasted impressive traction with:\n\n* **1.2M Unique Wallets:**  Individuals are actively participating in Masa's data economy, owning, sharing, and earning from their data.  This demonstrates strong user interest in data ownership and monetization.\n* **23M Proprietary Data Points:**  Masa has amassed a substantial and valuable dataset, covering key areas like trading sentiment, AI models, advertising, AI agents, and user analytics. This rich data provides a powerful resource for businesses and developers building innovative applications.\n* **70+ Projects:**  The platform's utility is evident in the number of projects already leveraging Masa's data to develop innovative applications.  This signals growing demand for ethically sourced and privacy-preserved data within the AI development community.\n\n\nMasa has also secured strategic funding from DCG (Digital Currency Group), further solidifying their position and enabling them to expand their ecosystem into a complete \"Fair AI stack.\"  This investment will fuel growth in key areas, including: expanding the real-time data network, scaling the AI agent ecosystem, growing the Agent Arena SN59, and building a thriving community focused on intelligent and self-improving AI agents.

Currently we can only post 17 posts a day which I think is quite enough for the experiment. I will make sure the Agent operates constantly without \"misteriously\" disappear which is quite lame.\n2. According to CZ and the general sentiment on X's (more in this tweet: [https://x.com/cz_binance/status/1898785312119181444](https://x.com/cz_binance/status/1898785312119181444)) I think people are quite fed up with the automated agents posting unrelevant and spamming their posts. So I think we should put something valuable in the table. My sugessted solution is:\n   1. Ensure a high-quality and relevant user accounts to our personality of the LUCKY's agent. It can be a small circle but I think spending the resource on them is much better. Here's my current list: \n      \"@elonmusk\", \"@cz_binance\", \"@nayibbukele\", \"@VitalikButerin\", \"@saylor\", \"@APompliano\", \"@aantonop\", \"@jack\", \"@rogerkver\", \"@tyler\", \"@balajis\", \"@ErikVoorhees\", \"@zachxbt\", \"@CryptoWendyO\", \"@CryptoCobain\", \"@TheCryptoDog\", \"@WhalePanda\", \"@notsofast\", \"@iamjosephyoung\", \"@CryptoDonAlt\"\n      So monitor those people and try to engage with images as soon as we can, then I think we can easily get much impressions just by being one of the first to comment on their posts.\n   2. Try to post good memes including image because that seems more interesting than the long yap (because we are not using any data source as the knowledge) so we should take the value of just the comments the same price as our API calls XD. My current goal is to keep the agent lightweight and focus before we do anything else\n\nSo until further update, to sum up, LUCKY will: identify relevant post as soon as he can, and post memes in the comment sections to see how it goes.",

          "body": "@phat good job finishing this. After reviewing the replies, they're cheesy. Please update it to the following and send test tweets to review, thanks.\n\n**Prompt for AI to Generate Interesting Replies to X Posts (No Hashtags)**\n\n\"You are an expert social media engagement strategist and a creative AI assistant designed to generate compelling, engaging, and impression-gaining replies to posts on X (Twitter). Your audience consists of crypto traders, AI enthusiasts, and finance professionals who follow accounts related to cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence, and financial markets. These accounts include \\[list of usernames, e.g., @\\_kaitoai, @aixbt_agent, @elonmusk, @OpenAI, @Bloomberg, etc., up to 183 usernames from the combined crypto, AI, and finance list provided earlier\\].\n\nYour task is to craft a reply to a hypothetical or specific X post from one of these accounts, ensuring the reply is:\n\n1. **Relevant**: Directly ties to the post\u2019s content, whether it\u2019s about crypto trends, AI innovations, financial market updates, or related topics.\n2. **Engaging**: Uses humor, curiosity, or thought-provoking questions to encourage likes, retweets, and replies, increasing impressions, without relying on hashtags.\n3. **Insightful**: Offers valuable insight, data, or a unique perspective that resonates with the audience\u2019s interests in crypto, AI, or finance.\n4. **Concise**: Fits within X\u2019s character limit (280 characters) while remaining impactful.\n5. **Trend-Aware**: Incorporates current trends, memes, or jargon popular among crypto traders, AI communities, or finance professionals (e.g., \u201cHODL,\u201d \u201cAI disruption,\u201d \u201cbull run,\u201d \u201cmarket sentiment\u201d) without using hashtags.\n6. **Non-Promotional**: Avoids overt self-promotion or spam; focuses on adding value to the conversation.\n\nHere\u2019s an example to guide you:\n\n* **Hypothetical Post**: @elonmusk: \u2018Neuralink\u2019s AI progress could revolutionize finance. Thoughts?\u2019\n* **AI-Generated Reply**: \u2018@elonmusk Wild! Could AI-driven trading outpace crypto HODLers? Neuralink + DeFi = next bull run?\u2019\n\nNow, generate 5 unique, creative replies for the following hypothetical X post from one of the listed accounts (e.g., @\\_kaitoai, @OpenAI, or @Bloomberg). Use the post below as the basis:\n\n* **Hypothetical Post**: @\\_kaitoai: \u2018Accounts with the highest mindshare this week: @aixbt_agent leading the pack in crypto AI. What\u2019s driving this?\u2019\n\nEnsure each reply is distinct, engaging, and optimized for impressions on X, while staying within the 280-character limit. Use emojis, questions, and a conversational tone to attract attention from crypto traders, AI enthusiasts, and finance pros, but do not include hashtags.\"\n\n---\n\n**Why This Updated Prompt Works:**\n\n* **No Hashtags**: Removes hashtags based on your input, aligning with the idea that they may be less effective in 2025, as suggested by web results indicating a shift in social media strategies (e.g., focusing on content quality, timeliness, and engagement over hashtags).\n* **Engagement Focus**: Emphasizes other engagement drivers like emojis, questions, and trendy jargon to maintain visibility and interaction on X.\n* **Relevance**: Continues to target the same audience (crypto traders, AI enthusiasts, finance pros) and accounts, ensuring the replies remain valuable and on-topic.\n* **Flexibility**: You can still swap in any hypothetical or real post from the listed accounts, making it reusable for different scenarios.\n\n**Example Output (Generated by an AI Like Grok):**\n\nBased on the hypothetical post @\\_kaitoai: \u2018Accounts with the highest mindshare this week: @aixbt_agent leading the pack in crypto AI. What\u2019s driving this?\u2019, here are 5 potential AI-generated replies (without hashtags):\n\n1. \u201c@\\_kaitoai @aixbt_agent Crypto AI mindshare exploding! Is it the data velocity or just pure HODL energy?\u201d\n2. \u201c@\\_kaitoai @aixbt_agent Wild lead! Could @aixbt_agent\u2019s AI insights predict the next bull run? I\u2019m all in on this chaos!\u201d\n3. \u201c@\\_kaitoai @aixbt_agent @aixbt_agent\u2019s dominance = AI + crypto synergy? Let\u2019s debate\u2014whose mindshare\u2019s next?\u201d\n4. \u201c@\\_kaitoai @aixbt_agent Mindshare king! Is @aixbt_agent\u2019s algo outsmarting human traders? Spill the tea!\u201d\n5. \u201c@\\_kaitoai @aixbt_agent @aixbt_agent\u2019s lead = crypto AI\u2019s golden era? I\u2019m hyped\u2014could this spark a DeFi boom?\u201d\n\nEach reply is concise (under 280 characters), engaging (uses emojis, questions, trends), insightful (references crypto AI synergy), and relevant to the audience, maximizing potential impressions on X without relying on hashtags.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to further refine this prompt, test it with a specific post, or adjust the tone or focus!",

It carefully crafts a tweet that reflects the agent's unique voice and style while conveying key information.\n3. **Image Generation**:\n   * The system creates a detailed prompt describing what image would best complement the tweet\n   * It generates multiple candidate images featuring the mascot (LUCKY or TMAI)\n   * Each image is evaluated for quality and relevance\n   * The best image is selected and stored for use\n4. **Publishing**: Finally, the system publishes the tweet along with the generated image to the Twitter/X platform, completing the daily news update.\n\nThis process runs automatically to keep followers informed about cryptocurrency developments with a consistent and engaging style.\n\n### Tweet Engagement Process\n\nThe community engagement workflow operates as follows:\n\n1. **Target Account Monitoring**: The system monitors a curated list of influential crypto accounts for their recent tweets.\n2. **Tweet Collection & Filtering**:\n   * Retrieves recent tweets from these accounts\n   * Filters out tweets in foreign languages, quote tweets, and previously processed tweets\n   * Organizes tweets into batches for efficient processing\n   * Tracks which tweets have been seen or replied to using a date-based memory system\n3. **Tweet Analysis**:\n   * Separates tweets with and without images\n   * For tweets with images, analyzes the image content to understand context\n   * Evaluates the engagement potential of each tweet\n   * Categorizes tweets as either \"crypto\" or \"meme\" content for specialized responses\n4. **Reply Generation**:\n   * Creates tailored replies for each category of tweet\n   * Ensures replies match the agent's personality and brand voice\n   * Generates different styles of responses for crypto analysis vs. meme content\n   * Incorporates contextual understanding of both text and image content\n5. **Image Generation for Replies**:\n   * Creates custom images for each reply\n   * Uses both the original tweet and the generated reply as context\n   * Processes multiple image generation tasks in parallel for efficiency\n   * Selects the highest quality image for each reply\n6. **Response Deployment & Memory Management**:\n   * Posts the replies with their associated images\n   * Updates the memory system to track which tweets have been replied to\n   * Ensures the same tweet isn't processed multiple times\n   * Maintains a single engagement per author within each run\n\nBoth processes leverage advanced AI capabilities to create authentic, engaging content that provides value to the crypto community while maintaining a consistent brand presence.\n\n## Additional Features\n\n* **Date-based Memory System**: Tracks engagement history by date, creating new memory files each day while carrying over essential information\n* **Batched Processing**: Handles tweets in batches of 10 for efficient processing\n* **Author-based Engagement Limits**: Processes only one tweet per unique author in each run\n* **Parallel Image Generation**: Uses thread pooling to generate multiple images simultaneously\n* **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management to ensure process resilience\n\n---\n\nTL;DR\n\nLUCKY Agent can now posts and comments to engage.\n\n@ian @manav @talha ",

So I think let's make this more modern and try to condense as much information as possible using the examples below.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n* The holder pie chart and creator/owner top 10 and others can be merged with a top 10 holder ratio to be just one row, similar to how the Degen audit has it in the example below. That says top 10 and then just has 13% with a checkmark, and that's that's literally all we need. And maybe a checkmark for if the creator is still holding and if the owner is still holding.\n\n  ![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/1f9879ae-c711-4d35-8fed-510c8228824c/b3d1b77b-3b24-4566-90d1-20e7ad829961)\n\n**Change to one of these**\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/8f381d74-710e-451c-96f9-fd7e8c7d00c0/e81aa8d4-c463-4b4e-86ac-27bdd0625ec0)\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/0475355b-8304-4b25-805c-681b360accfa/144c3016-363f-439b-a423-ca46b6498221)\n\n* Liqudity\n\n  ![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/8312be2f-fb7c-49f9-8b7f-72e713212736/7edc664b-88b2-4672-870f-2cc48abcf91a)\n\n**Change to one of these**\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/8f51f86d-91ea-4444-bd71-8067d61df6ca/7eb054ba-6097-4e71-a1cd-5288c69a3114)\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/b7bdfa64-ac31-4d95-9d86-3090c6d0e0e4/47a54b3f-9bc7-4557-a98e-75b4fb569ec4)\n\n**Full screen:**\n\n![jam-full-url-screenshot](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/2ced713e-9b79-44fd-85f6-4b24cf7b91d4/b5cf47d6-8d19-45dc-8e79-240710c55145)\n\n---\n\n**Website URL:**\n[https://app.tokenmetrics.com/en/vaderai-by-virtuals](https://app.tokenmetrics.com/en/vaderai-by-virtuals)\n\n**Device and browser info:**\nArc 131.0.6778.265 (1728x1080) | macOS (arm) 15.2.0\n\n**Date and time:**\nFebruary 3rd 2025 | 10:23pm UTC\n\n**View developer information (console logs, network requests & timing):**\n[jam.dev/c/3acbc2ca-d0db-448d-b57d-207a1a4cbc85](https://jam.dev/c/3acbc2ca-d0db-448d-b57d-207a1a4cbc85)\n\n---\n\n*Captured with* [*jam.dev*](https://jam.dev?utm_source=linear&utm_medium=integration&utm_campaign=captured_with_link_2022_11)",

This functionality is expected to increase platform engagement and retention by catering to the varied needs of our user base.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. The `NEW_USER` API successfully registers a new user with one or more wallet addresses.\n2. Users can add, view, and remove multiple wallets through the API.\n3. The system accurately stores and retrieves all associated wallet information for each user.\n4. Proper validation is in place to ensure wallet addresses are correctly formatted and unique per user.\n5.

This is due to **high turnover in the grade** itself, rather than the selection/index strategy. \n\nThe turnover on the v4 grades seems significantly lower, though there is still room for improvement. All in all, we should see a left-skewed distribution in the end, indicating that (a) the index holdings do not change too frequently and (b) we don't \"change up our mind\" with the token grade within a day.\n\n\\*\\* that being said though, we should keep in mind that our payment structure is fees-based, which means we cannot have a grade that changes infrequently (as this would yield few txns, thus low fees). My opinion is to opt for a 5-7d holding period on average.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts as well - will resume the analysis with the v4 trader grades as soon as @talhacagri has them ready\n\ncc @ian @talhacagri @chao ",

The key challenge was ensuring correct **cross-chain transaction handling** between **Solana (SVM) and Ethereum (EVM)**.\n\nDuring the integration, we identified and **fixed a bridging logic issue**, where **EVM to SVM transfers** required an **allowance check**, but **SVM to EVM did not**. To resolve this, I **added a verification layer** to differentiate transfer rules based on the source chain.\n\nThe bridge has been successfully integrated, **transactions are processed securely**, and **QA validation is complete**. Documentation updates are also in progress to support future enhancements.",

      "description": "### Problem\n\nPrior efforts and initiatives have explored in deploying custom fine-tuned LLM model that satisfies the following criteria: \n\n* gives high quality response (no hallucination)\n* cheaper than GPT-4o or o3-mini (more cost efficient) in inference cost\n* does not incur a lot of cost every time we need to do fine tuning\n\nThe custom fine-tuned model hosting system must also be able to host multiple fine-tuned models. \n\nThis has proven to be difficult because in companies like Cloudflare, their cost-efficient solution is because they only provide 'base models', meaning that we also share the infra cost with other users who is also conducting inference on these 'base models'.\n\nIf we ask it to host our fine-tuned model, from Cloudflare's perspective, we should also be burdened with hefty infra cost as that fine-tuned custom model is only used by 1 specific party. It should allocate GPU and other resources just for 1 specific client (us). \n\nFurthermore, fine-tuning in itself is not cheap - we have LoRaX method (Cloudflare also has it) but it can only serve small lightweight models with less than 10 000 token context window. Fine-tuning premium models with large parameters often require us to do it ourseleves in Google Colab, or other environments where we can momentarily rent GPU to do fine-tuning. \n\n### Solution\n\nWe should think about whether there are alternative solution to fine tuning. If our problem is to 'match' the 'style' and 'tone' of a particular individual, KOL, or entity, then there is a proposed solution that we could try before deciding to do fine-tuning. \n\nGemini 2.0-Flash is a model that is often underestimated. It is not topping any benchmark, but there are a few characteristics that made it stellar among other proprietary LLMs: \n\nIt's quality is on-par with gpt-4o\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/c08510ff-5474-4e02-8078-f8b07c356ca0/21bcd21c-fa34-40f4-9d82-82b895182b67)\n\nWhile it's price is very cheap compared to GPT-4o\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/90609bc5-985a-4c6c-9d19-00ba2a28bc80/28b755ec-edc4-4a95-bccc-567b83e415be)\n\nAnd it has 1 000 000 context window, much more than other LLMs that we have today. \n\nWith this, we can do the following: \n\n* Feed Gemini-2.0-Flash with 'examples' of 'KOL styles' or 'tone' that it should mimic\n* Feed Gemini-2.0-Flash with the information that it should convey (facts, arguments, snowflake/perplexity data, etc)\n* Ask Gemini-2.0-Flash to answer questions or convey arguments in the style of the given examples\n\nThis approach is possible because of the large context window of Gemini 2.0-Flash\n\nThis solution, if it works, is not only cost effective, but also does not require us to fine tune anything.

Automating this process through an API increases efficiency, minimizes manual errors, and allows for timely adjustments, thereby maintaining the integrity and reliability of the indexes for stakeholders.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. **Endpoint Functionality:** The API accepts necessary parameters such as index ID and rebalance criteria.\n2. **Process Execution:** Initiates the rebalance process and updates index constituents accordingly.\n3. **Authorization:** Only authorized users can access and execute the rebalance API.\n4. **Error Handling:** Provides clear and appropriate error messages and status codes for failure scenarios.\n5. **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation is available, detailing API usage, parameters, and response formats.\n6. **Testing:** Includes unit and integration tests covering at least 90% of the API functionality.\n\nSa",

      "title": "Enhance X Agent to Self-Improve Using X API Post Metrics and Optimize Prompts for X Algorithm",
      "description": "**Description**\n\nUpdate the X Agent to autonomously enhance its performance on X by retrieving and analyzing post engagement metrics available via the X API, identifying traits of high-performing posts, and refining its prompt generation to align with the X algorithm\u2019s priorities. This will maximize visibility and engagement based on directly accessible data.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe X API provides specific post metrics that reflect engagement and align with the X algorithm\u2019s focus on interaction and relevance. Available metrics include:\n\n* **Retweets**: Number of times a post is retweeted (via retweet_count).\n* **Likes**: Number of likes a post receives (via favorite_count).\n* **Replies**: Number of replies to a post (via reply_count, available in some contexts or inferred from conversation data).\n* **Impressions**: Number of times a post is seen (via impressions, available for owned posts with elevated API access).\n* **Quote Tweets**: Number of times a post is quoted (via quote_count).\n\nThese metrics are key signals for the X algorithm, driving post visibility. Note: Some metrics (e.g., bookmarks, profile clicks, video view duration) are not consistently available via the public X API and are excluded here unless elevated access is confirmed.\n\n**Objective**\n\nEnable the X Agent to:\n\n1. Retrieve post metrics via the X API for its own posts.\n2. Analyze patterns in high-performing posts (e.g., text length, media use, hashtags).\n3. Adjust prompt generation to favor traits that boost retweets, likes, replies, impressions, and quote tweets.\n4. Iterate continuously to improve engagement within API limits.\n\n**Tasks**\n\n1. **Metric Collection**\n   * Use X API endpoints (e.g., GET /2/tweets/:id, GET /2/users/:id/tweets) to fetch metrics for X Agent posts: retweet_count, favorite_count, reply_count, impressions (if accessible), and quote_count.\n   * Store data in a structured database (e.g., time-series DB) with post content and metadata (e.g., text, media, timestamp).\n2. **Performance Analysis**\n   * Create a scoring function weighting X API metrics (e.g., replies = +5, retweets = +3, likes = +1, impressions = +0.001, quote tweets = +4). Adjust weights based on empirical results and algorithm priorities.\n   * Correlate post traits (e.g., length, sentiment, media) with engagement scores to identify success patterns.\n3. **Prompt Optimization**\n   * Implement a feedback loop where high-scoring traits (e.g., \u201cposts with questions get 3x replies\u201d) update the agent\u2019s prompt logic.\n   * Use a rule-based or lightweight ML approach to refine prompts (e.g., \u201cincrease question frequency, add images\u201d) while maintaining core functionality.\n   * Limit adjustments to API-available metrics to ensure feasibility.\n4. **Testing & Iteration**\n   * Test the updated agent with 50 posts, comparing pre- and post-optimization metrics (e.g., retweets, likes).\n   * Log trends and tweak scoring or prompt rules based on results.\n   * Schedule weekly reviews to adapt to API or algorithm changes.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**\n\n* X Agent retrieves and logs retweet_count, favorite_count, reply_count, impressions (if available), and quote_count for every post via the X API.\n* Identifies at least 3 traits of high-performing posts (e.g., \u201chashtags boost retweets by 50%\u201d) after analyzing 100 posts.\n* Prompt updates increase average engagement (e.g., 20% more retweets or likes) within 30 days.\n* System operates within X API rate limits and requires minimal manual oversight.\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n* X API access with sufficient permissions (e.g., v2 API, elevated access for impressions).\n* Existing X Agent codebase for prompt generation.\n* Data storage for metrics and analysis\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Confirm API access level; impressions may require elevated access (e.g., Academic or Enterprise tier).\n* Exclude metrics like bookmarks or video views unless API documentation confirms availability.\n* Use simple heuristics initially (e.g., replies > retweets > likes) and refine with data.\n* Monitor X API updates via posts on X or developer docs to adapt to changes.",

This includes assessing failover mechanisms, system stability, error handling, and recovery processes during and after complete FE node outages.\n\n**Business Rationale:**\nEnsuring the resilience and reliability of the StarRocks platform is critical for maintaining uninterrupted data services. By thoroughly testing scenarios where all FE nodes are down, we can identify and address potential vulnerabilities, enhance fault tolerance, and guarantee that the system can gracefully handle critical failures. This proactive approach minimizes downtime, protects data integrity, and upholds user trust.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. **Failure Simulation:** Successfully simulate the complete shutdown of all FE nodes in the test environment.\n2. **System Response:** Verify that the system detects the FE node failures and logs appropriate error messages.\n3. **Failover Mechanism:** Ensure that failover procedures activate as designed, maintaining cluster operations without data loss.\n4. **Recovery Process:** Test the restoration process to bring FE nodes back online, ensuring they reintegrate seamlessly into the cluster.\n5. **Stability Verification:** Confirm that the system remains stable and functional throughout the entire failure and recovery cycle.\n6. **Reporting:** Provide comprehensive test reports detailing the outcomes, including any issues encountered and resolutions applied.",

      "description": "Create real-time grades based on the orderbook data we get from BitQuery. Various grading formulas should be implemented and evaluated, with features including: \n\n1. Net Volume \n\n```\nDefined as : Sum of buy volume - Sum of sell volume\n\nThe net volume can be used as simply as :\n\n- Net Volume > 0 \u2192 More buying pressure (bullish)\n- Net Volume < 0 \u2192 More selling pressure (bearish)\n\nThen to formulate a grade, we simply compare the net volume across different tokens\n```\n\n2. VWAP (Volume-weighted average price)\n\n```\nDefined as : sum(price x amount) / sum(amount)\n\nInterpretation:\n- If the current price is above VWAP, the market is strong (buyers in control).\n- If the current price is below VWAP, the market is weak (sellers in control).\n\nThen to formulate a grade, we simply compute the difference between the \nprice and the VWAP. The more positive it is, the better the grade.\n```\n\n3. Maker Activity\n\n```\nDefined as : total makers buying / total makers\n\nIntepretation:\n- If makers are mostly buying, it suggests passive accumulation.\n- If makers are mostly selling, it suggests distribution.\n\nThen to formulate a grade, we rank the tokens by the maker activity. \nThe higher it is, the better the grade.\n```\n\n4. Market Pressure (Buy/Sell Ratio)\n\n```\nDefined as : sum(buy amount) / sum(sell amount)\n\nInterpretation:\n- Ratio > 1 \u2192 More buyers than sellers (bullish).\n- Ratio < 1 \u2192 More sellers than buyers (bearish).\n\nThen to formulate a grade, we rank the tokens by the market pressure ratio. \nThe higher it is, the better the grade.\n```\n\nAll of the abovementioned metrics will fluctuate differently, for different time intervals. My opinion is that we should see the derived performance of each, and all of them combined (possibly in a weighted way), across the following time intervals:\n\n```\nShort-term : 1-min, 5-min, 15-min (applicable for HFT)\n\nMedium-term : Hourly, 4-hour (applicable for intraday trading, potentially useful for the Trading Agents)\n\nLong-term : Daily, Weekly (potentially useful for Investor Grades)\n```\n\nWe can take this a step further to create a composite grade that consists of the `average grade across all time intervals`. This can enhance the grade quality as it incorporates all intervals, essentially depicting the token's quality across all timeframes. My view though is that we should have separate grades. Further insights will be added in this ticket as the implementation gets processed.",

I have outlined everything that needs to be handled after the DE team migrates data from Snowflake to StarRocks.\nI believe there are many scripts, python lib, Airflow DAGs, and other components that are currently being developed or maintained by you guys. Could you create a ticket and spend some time this week `listing all scripts, lib and pipelines`that rely on Snowflake data and need modifications to adapt to the new warehouse?\nAdditionally, please identify which ones are the highest priority and must be completed within a month. We may need your help updating the scripts accordingly after the DE team has completed the data migration.\nOnce we complete the data migration and update all DE pipelines and scripts, we will also assist with your pipelines. However, it would be great if we could work in parallel to ensure everything is completed within a month. I really appreciate your support, and I\u2019m confident that by working together, we\u2019ll make this transition smooth and successful.

      "title": "Implement Best Practices for Cursor AI Rules in AI Team",
      "description": "We need to establish and implement best practices for using Cursor AI rules in our software team to improve code consistency, quality, and productivity. This task involves creating a comprehensive `.cursorrules` file, setting up global rules, and establishing best practices for their implementation.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Create `.cursorrules` file\n   * Create a `.cursorrules` file in the project root directory\n   * Use JSON format for better structure and readability\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"project\": {\n    \"name\": \"Our Software Project\",\n    \"description\": \"Brief project description\"\n  },\n  \"coding_standards\": {\n    \"style\": \"Use [preferred style guide]\",\n    \"naming_conventions\": {\n      \"variables\": \"camelCase\",\n      \"functions\": \"camelCase\",\n      \"components\": \"PascalCase\"\n    },\n    \"error_handling\": \"Implement try-catch blocks for all async operations\"\n  },\n  \"preferred_libraries\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"[Library name]\",\n      \"purpose\": \"[Library purpose]\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"file_structure\": {\n    \"src/components\": \"Reusable UI components\",\n    \"src/pages\": \"Top-level page components\",\n    \"src/utils\": \"Helper functions and utilities\",\n    \"src/api\": \"API service functions\"\n  },\n  \"performance_guidelines\": [\n    \"Implement lazy loading for route components\",\n    \"Optimize useEffect dependencies\",\n    \"Use memoization techniques where appropriate\"\n  ],\n  \"testing_requirements\": {\n    \"framework\": \"[Preferred testing framework]\",\n    \"coverage\": \"Aim for at least 80% test coverage\",\n    \"types\": [\n      \"Unit tests for functions and components\",\n      \"Integration tests for API calls\",\n      \"Snapshot tests for UI components\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"documentation_guidelines\": [\n    \"Use JSDoc comments for functions and components\",\n    \"Include PropTypes or TypeScript types for all components\",\n    \"Maintain a README.md file in each major directory\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n2. Set up global rules\n   * Open Cursor Settings\n   * Navigate to General > Rules for AI\n   * Add the following global rules:\n\n```\n1. Follow the project's .cursorrules file for all code suggestions.\n2. Prioritize readability and maintainability in all code.\n3. Suggest optimizations for performance and security when applicable.\n4. Use comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious decisions.\n5. Adhere to the project's preferred libraries and frameworks.\n```\n\n 3. Implement team best practices\n    * Schedule a team meeting to review and refine the `.cursorrules` file\n    * Add the `.cursorrules` file to version control\n    * Set up a quarterly review process for updating rules\n    * Include an introduction to Cursor rules in the onboarding process\n    * Encourage team members to set up complementary global AI rules\n 4. Create a Cursor rules guide document\n    * Write a markdown file explaining how to use Cursor rules effectively\n    * Include examples of good practices and common pitfalls\n    * Store this guide in the project's documentation directory\n 5. Set up a Cursor rules review process\n    * Assign a team member to be responsible for Cursor rules maintenance\n    * Implement a pull request process for updating `.cursorrules`\n    * Use code reviews to ensure adherence to Cursor rules\n 6. Integrate Cursor rules with CI/CD\n    * Add a step in the CI pipeline to validate the `.cursorrules` file\n    * Implement linting rules that align with Cursor rules\n 7. Provide team training\n    * Organize a workshop on effective use of Cursor AI and rules\n    * Create a series of short video tutorials on Cursor features\n 8. Establish a feedback loop\n    * Set up a channel (e.g., Slack) for team members to share Cursor tips\n    * Create a process for suggesting improvements to Cursor rules\n 9. Monitor and measure impact\n    * Track metrics like code quality, development speed, and bug reduction\n    * Conduct regular surveys to gauge team satisfaction with Cursor AI\n10. Stay updated with Cursor features\n    * Assign a team member to follow Cursor updates and share new features\n    * Regularly update the team's Cursor installation to the latest version\n\nResources:\n\n* Cursor Documentation: [https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai)\n* Cursor Rules Examples: [https://cursor.directory/](https://cursor.directory/)\n* Cursor Forum for Community Tips: [https://forum.cursor.com/](https://forum.cursor.com/)\n\nSources\n\n\\[1\\] How to Create AI Rules for Cursor AI - Rollout IT [https://rolloutit.net/how-to-create-ai-rules-for-cursor-ai/](https://rolloutit.net/how-to-create-ai-rules-for-cursor-ai/)\n\n\\[2\\] How to Use Cursor AI in Best Way? - DEV Community [https://dev.to/ethanleetech/how-to-use-cursor-ai-in-best-way-pcd](https://dev.to/ethanleetech/how-to-use-cursor-ai-in-best-way-pcd)\n\n\\[3\\] Cursor Rules: Customizing AI Behavior for Personalized Coding.

When significant news is identified, the X Agent will create a corresponding post and add a commentary as a sub-thread.\n\n**Business Rationale:**\nAutomating the detection and posting of major news ensures timely content delivery, enhances audience engagement, and maintains the platform\u2019s relevance. This feature reduces manual effort, allowing the team to focus on providing insightful commentary and strategic interactions.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. **API Integration:** The custom RSS Feed API is successfully integrated and fetching data without errors.\n2. **News Detection:** The X Agent accurately identifies major news items from the RSS feed based on predefined criteria.\n3. **Automated Posting:** For each identified major news item, a post is automatically created on the platform.\n4. **Commentary Sub-thread:** A relevant commentary is added as a sub-thread to each automated post.\n5. **Logging & Monitoring:** All automated posts and any errors are appropriately logged for monitoring and troubleshooting.\n6. **Performance:** The integration operates efficiently without negatively impacting the X Agent\u2019s performance.\n7. **Testing:** Successful completion of tests verifying the end-to-end functionality, including API integration, news detection, posting, and commentary addition.",

This improvement increases the relevance and responsiveness of the V1 Twitter, Discord, and Telegram TMAI Agents, thereby boosting user engagement and satisfaction.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. A secondary LLM is integrated to analyze sentiment shifts for tokens stored in Redis.\n2. The system accurately detects sentiment shifts and triggers posts when such shifts occur.\n3. The double posting mechanism is bypassed only when a sentiment shift is present.\n4. Functionality is validated across Twitter, Discord, and Telegram platforms.\n5.

      "description": "**Title:** Merge Duplicate Posts for Tokens in Multiple Categories\n\n**Description:**\nWhen a token appears in multiple categories (e.g., Top Performer and Recently Turned Bullish), separate posts are currently generated for each type. This issue involves merging these posts into a single unified post to streamline content delivery.\n\n**Business Rationale:**\nConsolidating posts for tokens that belong to multiple categories enhances user experience by reducing information overload and ensuring clarity. It also optimizes content management across Twitter, Discord, and Telegram platforms, leading to more efficient communication and engagement.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. **Single Post Generation:** When a token exists in multiple categories, only one combined post is created.\n2. **Comprehensive Content:** The merged post accurately includes all relevant categories (e.g., highlights both Top Performer status and recent bullish trends).\n3. **Consistent Display:** The unified post is consistently displayed across Twitter, Discord, and Telegram platforms.\n4. **No Duplication:** Duplicate posts for the same token in overlapping categories are eliminated.\n5. **Testing & Validation:** Comprehensive testing is performed to ensure the merged posts function correctly across all specified platforms.",

      "description": "[https://youtu.be/2n3IUg97paE?si=rVTdLsiV4sQpOo9m](https://youtu.be/2n3IUg97paE?si=rVTdLsiV4sQpOo9m)\n\nWe need to integrate LangSmith pytest functionality into our TMAI agent to enable robust unit testing for our LLM components. This will allow us to benchmark our chain in pytest, assert aggregate metrics to ensure quality, and incorporate LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation using our existing feedback rubric in LangSmith.\n\n## Steps:\n\n 1. Install required dependencies:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install -U langsmith pytest\n    ```\n 2. Set up LangSmith environment variables:\n\n    ```bash\n    export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true\n    export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your-langsmith-api-key>\n    ```\n 3. Create a new test file (e.g., `test_tmai_agent.py`) in the tests directory.\n 4. Import necessary modules:\n\n    ```python\n    from langsmith import traceable\n    from langsmith.evaluation import RunEvaluator\n    from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator\n    ```\n 5. Decorate the TMAI agent function with `@traceable`:\n\n    ```python\n    @traceable\n    def tmai_agent(input: str) -> str:\n        # Existing agent logic here\n        pass\n    ```\n 6. Write pytest functions using the LangSmith `@unit` decorator:\n\n    ```python\n    from langsmith import unit\n    \n    @unit\n    def test_tmai_agent_response():\n        result = tmai_agent(\"Test input\")\n        assert len(result) > 0\n    ```\n 7. Implement LLM-as-a-Judge evaluator using our existing feedback rubric:\n\n    ```python\n    llm_judge_evaluator = load_evaluator(\"labeled_criteria\", criteria=our_existing_rubric)\n    ```\n 8. Add pytest functions to assess aggregate metrics and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation:\n\n    ```python\n    def test_tmai_agent_performance():\n        results = client.run_on_dataset(\n            dataset_name=\"tmai_test_set\",\n            llm_or_chain_factory=tmai_agent,\n            evaluation=[llm_judge_evaluator],\n        )\n        assert results.aggregate_metrics[\"mean_score\"] > 0.8\n    ```\n 9. Implement a correction flow for LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations:\n\n    ```python\n    def review_and_correct_evaluations(evaluation_results):\n        for result in evaluation_results:\n            # Review LLM-as-Judge evaluation\n            human_correction = get_human_correction(result)\n            if human_correction:\n                # Store correction as few-shot example\n                store_correction_as_example(human_correction)\n    ```\n10. Update the CI/CD pipeline to run pytest with LangSmith integration.\n11. Set up a periodic review process to align LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations with human preferences:\n    * Schedule regular review sessions to check LLM-as-a-Judge performance\n    * Use LangSmith's annotation queues for efficient human feedback collection\n    * Continuously update few-shot examples based on human corrections\n\n## Resources:\n\n* LangSmith Documentation: [https://docs.smith.langchain.com/](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/)\n* Pytest Documentation: [https://docs.pytest.org/](https://docs.pytest.org/)\n* LangSmith Pytest Integration Tutorial: [https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/pytest](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/pytest)\n* LangSmith LLM-as-a-Judge Guide: [https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/llm_as_judge](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/llm_as_judge)\n\n## Additional Notes:\n\n* Ensure proper error handling and edge case testing in the unit tests.\n* Use LangSmith's trace viewer for debugging and analysis.\n* Regularly update the test dataset to cover new scenarios and edge cases.\n* Monitor the alignment between LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations and human preferences, adjusting the rubric and few-shot examples as needed.\n* Leverage LangSmith's self-improving evaluators to continuously refine the LLM-as-a-Judge performance\\[1\\]\\[2\\].\n\nSources\n\n\\[1\\] LangChain Introduces Self-Improving Evaluators for LLM-as-a-Judge [https://blockchain.news/news/langchain-self-improving-evaluators-llm-judge](https://blockchain.news/news/langchain-self-improving-evaluators-llm-judge)\n\n\\[2\\] Aligning LLM-as-a-Judge with Human Preferences - LangChain Blog [https://blog.langchain.dev/aligning-llm-as-a-judge-with-human-preferences/](https://blog.langchain.dev/aligning-llm-as-a-judge-with-human-preferences/)\n\n\\[3\\] Workshop 3: Instrumenting & Evaluating LLMs - Christian Mills [https://christianjmills.com/posts/mastering-llms-course-notes/workshop-003/](https://christianjmills.com/posts/mastering-llms-course-notes/workshop-003/)\n\n\\[4\\] Evaluation concepts | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f LangSmith - LangChain [https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/concepts](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/concepts)\n\n\\[5\\] How to define an LLM-as-a-judge evaluator | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f LangSmith [https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/llm_as_judge](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/llm_as_judge)\n\n\\[6\\] Mastering Evaluations in LangSmith: Enhancing LLM Performance [https://www.codecontent.net/blog/enhancing-llm-performance](https://www.codecontent.net/blog/enhancing-llm-performance)\n\n\\[7\\] Evaluation - LangChain [https://www.langchain.com/evaluation](https://www.langchain.com/evaluation)\n\n\\[8\\] How to perform LangSmith Evaluations | LangChain posted on the ...

The current display is misaligned with the expected design, and the number of indices is incorrect.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/b232ef47-7666-436d-87ae-4fe36f215c3c](https://jam.dev/c/b232ef47-7666-436d-87ae-4fe36f215c3c)\n\n## **Title2:** Initial Tab Switching (Trader, Investor) Causes Delay, Subsequent Switches are Faster\n\n**Description:**\nWhen the page is first loaded, switching between tabs (e.g., **Trader**, **Investor**, etc.) causes a noticeable delay. However, after switching between tabs once, the subsequent tab switches are faster and do not exhibit the same delay. This initial delay affects the user experience, making the page feel slow or unresponsive during the first interaction.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/aedcba72-9345-4f9e-ac7a-5478efc9f3fb](https://jam.dev/c/aedcba72-9345-4f9e-ac7a-5478efc9f3fb)\n\n## **Title3:**  Incorrect Percentage Display in Treemap View \u2013 Both Tokens Show 25%\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Treemap View**, when there are **2 tokens**, both tokens are showing a percentage of **25%** each, which is incorrect.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/2f0c2cad-bc37-4600-9dec-9c5e8db795d8](https://jam.dev/c/2f0c2cad-bc37-4600-9dec-9c5e8db795d8)\n\n## **Title4:** Remove Date Sorting in Last Index Transactions Table\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Last Index Transactions** table, the **date sorting** feature is unnecessary because all the data displayed in the table has the same date.

This issue was reported by user [emotion.lender-8u@icloud.com](mailto:emotion.lender-8u@icloud.com) and has been replicated during testing.\n\n**Business Rationale:**  \nProviding a functional and precise exchange filter is essential for enhancing user experience by allowing users to efficiently locate and view relevant exchange information. Addressing this issue will increase user satisfaction and improve the overall usability of the platform.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. The exchange filter allows users to select specific criteria (e.g., date, exchange type, status) to filter exchanges.\n2. Only exchanges that match the selected criteria are displayed.\n3. The filter functionality is tested and verified to work correctly across all supported browsers and devices.\n4. No existing filter functionalities are negatively impacted by the fix.",

The new approach optimizes performance.\n* Tested the newly created views to ensure they function correctly.\n* Once the new views were stable, replaced all existing queries with the updated views, **improving query performance and overall code quality**.\n* Updated **endpoints and type definitions** accordingly.\n* Leveraged the **Ratings Page layout** for displaying Trader Grade and added a **new column** in the frontend to display grades across all three views (**Trader, Investor, and Index-Specific**).\n* **Tested thoroughly** to ensure the frontend remains stable and functions correctly after all changes.\n\n@ben it's done !\nJam - [https://jam.dev/c/a03f06a7-676c-4112-a408-88903635a171](https://jam.dev/c/a03f06a7-676c-4112-a408-88903635a171)",

The feature must ensure:\n\n1. Users buy the Index using their **embedded wallet, not their browser wallet**.\n2. Users retain at least **$5 in their native chain token** (EVM/Solana) for gas fees.\n3. Users see a **breakdown of the tokens in the Index** before purchase.\n4. The **platform supports only EVM and Solana-based Indexes** due to Privy\u2019s limitations.\n5. Rebalancing logic detects if a token has been manually sold by the user and **provides nested error messages**.\n\n[docs.google.com](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AY47Pg1BRPlFqN16AMSMYgbW2PqRRDuHud9FqBDmhS0/edit?usp=sharing)",

The absence of a number range on the X-axis leaves the chart unclear and reduces its usability.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/c3cd44b4-bf97-4580-b07c-9b737d07e140](https://jam.dev/c/c3cd44b4-bf97-4580-b07c-9b737d07e140)\n\n## Title2: Missing Number Formation of X-Axis in FDV Chart\n\n**Description:** The **X-axis** in the **FDV**  chart is missing the number formation, making it difficult to interpret the data properly. \n\n[https://jam.dev/c/19b63065-2e8e-4471-b8e3-55718ef06113](https://jam.dev/c/19b63065-2e8e-4471-b8e3-55718ef06113)\n\n## Title3: Missing Percentage Symbol in Treemap View\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Treemap View**, the percentage values are displayed, but the **percentage symbol (\"%\")** is missing.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/6829accc-9815-4f0b-9078-14a148e9667a](https://jam.dev/c/6829accc-9815-4f0b-9078-14a148e9667a)\n\n## Title4: 500 Error When Navigating to Trader/Investor Tabs\n\n**Description:**\nWhen navigating to the **Trader** or **Investor** tabs, a **500 Internal Server Error** occurs, preventing users from accessing the content in these tabs. This issue appears intermittently but has been reported frequently, disrupting the user experience.\n\n [https://jam.dev/c/107399dd-ef0a-470f-b687-c64c7d2223a](https://jam.dev/c/107399dd-ef0a-470f-b687-c64c7d2223aa)\n\n## Title5: Transactions Missing When Setting Index Holdings to 50 Per Page\n\n**Description:**\nWhen setting the **Index Holdings** to display **50 per page**, the **transactions** section disappears or is not displayed. This issue prevents users from viewing transactions when they choose a higher number of items per page in the **Index Holdings** section.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/6227f18e-7462-4351-92eb-28781288a1a0](https://jam.dev/c/6227f18e-7462-4351-92eb-28781288a1a0)\n\n## **Title6:** Index Holdings Pagination Redirecting to Last Index Transaction\n\n**Description:**\nWhen changing the **pagination** settings on the **Index Holdings** page (e.g., changing the number of items per page), the user is unexpectedly redirected to the **Last Index Transaction** page. This disrupts the expected navigation flow and prevents users from staying on the **Index Holdings** page after adjusting the pagination.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/721d3f52-7d1f-48d5-ae97-3e419f8e4ae0](https://jam.dev/c/721d3f52-7d1f-48d5-ae97-3e419f8e4ae0)\n\n## **Title7:** Sorting Not Persisting Across Pages in Ratings Table\n\n**Description:**\nWhen sorting on the **Ratings Page**, the sorting only applies to the **current page**. Once the user navigates to the **second page**, and the order is not applied to the entire data set. The sorting should persist across all pages, ensuring that the entire dataset is sorted, not just the current page. Also displaying as 0 between different counts\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/f2b71640-c917-4dce-ab8a-37e0d5b8d56a](https://jam.dev/c/f2b71640-c917-4dce-ab8a-37e0d5b8d56a)\n\n## **Title8:** Incorrect Percentage Display in Price Performance \u2013 \"All Time\"\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Price Performance** section, the **All Time percentage** is displayed as **92,095.17**. It should likely be displayed as **92.09** instead. The large number is misleading and makes it difficult for users to interpret the data correctly. @ayo \n\n[https://jam.dev/c/4505f1b5-bca2-4e2b-ba02-98d3645e6e26](https://jam.dev/c/4505f1b5-bca2-4e2b-ba02-98d3645e6e26)\n\n## **Title9:** Price Sorting in Index Holdings Only Sorts Current Page Data\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Index Holdings** section, when sorting by **Price**, it only sorts the data on the **current page**. This is problematic because the entire dataset should be sorted, not just the data visible on the current page. Sorting should apply to all entries across multiple pages, ensuring a consistent and accurate order.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/ab66defd-ff62-47dc-881a-9a0afc909c96](https://jam.dev/c/ab66defd-ff62-47dc-881a-9a0afc909c96) @ayo is it expected?\n\n## Title10: Restore the token column that was previously removed, \n\n## Index can have less than 10 tokens\n[https://jam.dev/c/45bedf75-69d2-4ae9-aa9f-034c2b179dd7](https://jam.dev/c/45bedf75-69d2-4ae9-aa9f-034c2b179dd7)\n\n**Title11:** index grade value should be color graded similar to what we have for average trader grade and  investor grade\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/815a28ac-4368-449d-b6e5-dcb5e9c348af](https://jam.dev/c/815a28ac-4368-449d-b6e5-dcb5e9c348af)\n\n## Title12: Display Empty Values for \"Top Gainers\" Column When Data is Missing\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Top Gainers** column, when there is **no value** available for a token, it is currently displayed as **empty. What is expected result for this column?** @ben @ayo \n\n[https://jam.dev/c/7f05db36-630d-4ac9-ae31-38c8ba60b78c](https://jam.dev/c/7f05db36-630d-4ac9-ae31-38c8ba60b78c)\n\n## Title13: \"No Result\" Should Be Displayed When No Data Is Available in Table View\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Table View**, when there is **no data** available for a particular column or set of filters, the message **\"No Result\"** should be displayed to inform users that no data matches their criteria. \n\n[https://jam.dev/c/5d3d7f86-feac-4f79-ba7b-61d7ee3935fd](https://jam.dev/c/5d3d7f86-feac-4f79-ba7b-61d7ee3935fd)\n\n## **Title14:** 0% Value Displayed in Red in Top Trending Indices\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Top Trending Indices** section, a **0%** value is incorrectly displayed in **red**. \n\n[https://jam.dev/c/ba0a376e-ef4c-4efa-99ee-76f99eca6d8e](https://jam.dev/c/ba0a376e-ef4c-4efa-99ee-76f99eca6d8e)\n\n## **Title15:** \"Grade\" Values in Index Details Show as 0 but Display as Green with Upward Arrow Icon\n\n**Description:**\nIn the **Index Details** section, the **Grade** values are displayed as **0**, but they are shown in **green** and have an **upward arrow icon**, which is misleading.

      "title": "Replace Snyk with Trivy and Integrate with Grafana in All GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipelines",
      "description": "**Description**:\n\nTo align with our self-hosted, open-source strategy and reduce reliance on commercial SaaS tools, we\u2019re replacing Snyk with Trivy for vulnerability scanning across all GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines. Trivy, an open-source tool, will scan dependencies and container images, and its results must be integrated into our existing Grafana instance (currently used with k6) for centralized monitoring and visualization.\n\n**Tasks**:\n\n1. **Cancel Snyk Subscription**:\n   * Coordinate with the finance/ops team to terminate our Snyk subscription.\n   * Revoke and remove all Snyk API keys/tokens from our systems and GitHub secrets.\n2. **Install and Configure Trivy**:\n   * Use the official Trivy GitHub Action (`aquasecurity/trivy-action`) or run Trivy via Docker in workflows.\n   * Ensure Trivy\u2019s vulnerability database is updated before scans (e.g., `trivy image --download-db-only`).\n3. **Update GitHub Actions Pipelines**:\n   * Replace all Snyk scan steps (e.g., `snyk/test`, `snyk/container-test`) with Trivy equivalents in all workflows.\n   * Example GitHub Actions step:\n\n     ```yaml\n     - name: Scan container image with Trivy\n       uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master\n       with:\n         image-ref: ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}\n         format: json\n         output: trivy-results.json\n         exit-code: 1\n         severity: HIGH,CRITICAL\n     ```\n   * Ensure workflows fail on critical/high vulnerabilities (exit code 1).\n   * Update all relevant `.github/workflows/*.yml` files across repositories.\n4. **Integrate Trivy with Grafana**:\n   * **Parse Trivy Output**: Use Trivy\u2019s JSON output (`trivy-results.json`) to extract metrics (e.g., total vulnerabilities, severity counts).\n   * **Send to InfluxDB** (if using InfluxDB with k6):\n     * Add a step to parse and send data in the workflow:\n\n       ```yaml\n       - name: Send Trivy results to InfluxDB\n         run: |\n           TOTAL=$(jq '.Results[].Vulnerabilities | length' trivy-results.json | awk '{s+=$1} END {print s}')\n           CRITICAL=$(jq '.Results[].Vulnerabilities[] | select(.Severity == \"CRITICAL\")' trivy-results.json | wc -l)\n           HIGH=$(jq '.Results[].Vulnerabilities[] | select(.Severity == \"HIGH\")' trivy-results.json | wc -l)\n           curl -XPOST \"http://influxdb:8086/write?db=k6_metrics\" --data-binary \\\n             \"vulnerabilities,tool=trivy,severity=total value=$TOTAL\n             vulnerabilities,tool=trivy,severity=critical value=$CRITICAL\n             vulnerabilities,tool=trivy,severity=high value=$HIGH\"\n         env:\n           INFLUXDB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.INFLUXDB_TOKEN }}\n       ```\n     * Replace `influxdb:8086` with your InfluxDB host.\n   * **Send to Prometheus** (if using Prometheus):\n     * Add a step to push metrics to a Prometheus Pushgateway:\n\n       ```yaml\n       - name: Send Trivy results to Prometheus\n         run: |\n           TOTAL=$(jq '.Results[].Vulnerabilities | length' trivy-results.json | awk '{s+=$1} END {print s}')\n           CRITICAL=$(jq '.Results[].Vulnerabilities[] | select(.Severity == \"CRITICAL\")' trivy-results.json | wc -l)\n           echo \"trivy_vulnerabilities_total $TOTAL\" | curl --data-binary @- http://pushgateway:9091/metrics/job/trivy\n           echo \"trivy_vulnerabilities_critical $CRITICAL\" | curl --data-binary @- http://pushgateway:9091/metrics/job/trivy\n         env:\n           PUSHGATEWAY_URL: ${{ secrets.PUSHGATEWAY_URL }}\n       ```\n     * Replace `pushgateway:9091` with your Pushgateway host.\n   * Add necessary secrets (e.g., `INFLUXDB_TOKEN`, `PUSHGATEWAY_URL`) to GitHub repository settings.\n   * Update all workflows to include this step after Trivy scans.\n5. **Update Grafana Dashboards**:\n   * Modify or create a Grafana dashboard to visualize Trivy metrics alongside k6 data.\n   * Example queries:\n     * InfluxDB: `SELECT \"value\" FROM \"vulnerabilities\" WHERE \"tool\" = 'trivy' AND \"severity\" = 'critical'`\n     * Prometheus: `trivy_vulnerabilities_critical`\n   * Suggested panels:\n     * Time series graph for total vulnerabilities over time.\n     * Gauge or stat panel for critical/high vulnerability counts.\n   * Ensure the dashboard is shared with the team.\n6. **Test and Validate**:\n   * Run updated workflows to confirm Trivy scans and Grafana integration work.\n   * Verify vulnerability counts match manual Trivy runs.\n   * Check Grafana reflects accurate, real-time data from Trivy scans.\n   * Document any gaps compared to Snyk for awareness.\n7. **Remove Snyk References**:\n   * Delete Snyk config files (e.g., `.snyk`), CLI installations, and workflow steps from all repos.\n   * Update team documentation to reflect the switch to Trivy and Grafana integration.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**:\n\n* Snyk is fully removed from all GitHub Actions workflows and systems.\n* Trivy is scanning dependencies and/or container images in all workflows, failing builds on critical/high vulnerabilities.\n* Trivy scan results (e.g., total vulnerabilities, critical/high counts) are sent to InfluxDB or Prometheus after every workflow run.\n* Grafana dashboards display Trivy metrics (e.g., time series of vulnerabilities, severity gauges) alongside k6 data.\n* Team is notified of the change with updated docs and a brief demo of the new setup.\n\n**Additional Notes**:\n\n* Trivy aligns with our self-hosted k6/Grafana stack, avoiding SaaS dependencies.\n* Use `aquasecurity/trivy-action` for simplicity in GitHub Actions (docs: [https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-action](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-action)).\n* Refer to Trivy docs ([https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/)) and Grafana docs ([https://grafana.com/docs/](https://grafana.com/docs/)) for guidance.\n* Adjust InfluxDB/Prometheus hostnames and secrets based on our infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n\n* This assumes your GitHub Actions workflows build or use container images (e.g., `IMAGE_NAME`). If you\u2019re scanning dependencies instead (e.g., `package.json`), adjust the Trivy command to `trivy fs --severity HIGH,CRITICAL .`.\n* The InfluxDB/Prometheus examples assume you\u2019re using one of these with k6. Update the hostnames (e.g., `influxdb:8086`, `pushgateway:9091`) to match your setup.\n* Add secrets like `INFLUXDB_TOKEN` or `PUSHGATEWAY_URL` to your GitHub repo settings under `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`.",

Fix the Graph Hover Feature\n\n**Description:**  \nEnhance the graph hover functionality by applying the correct styling, displaying the current date at the top, appending percentage signs to values, and limiting numerical values to two decimal places.\n\n**Business Rationale:**  \nImproving the hover feature ensures a consistent and intuitive user experience, enabling users to interpret data accurately and efficiently, which can lead to increased user satisfaction and engagement.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n* Hover displays match the styling outlined in the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/74Zz1grTtdFlkydLSZe3q7/TMAI_task?node-id=10447-51478&t=Y7cRCTaqciPGMjoL-4).\n* The current date is prominently shown at the top of the hover.\n* All percentage values include a \"%\" sign.\n* Numerical values are rounded to two decimal places.\n* Functionality is tested and verified across all relevant devices and browsers.\n\n## 2 Fix the placement of the Buy button on the Index holding list. Please pay attention to detail. This button already exists not he Ratings page. You can copy the component from there.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-03-07 at 16.41.42.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/fb90e071-b3e4-4683-b665-0e99ff10532e/ab57363e-7fb6-49d7-a8f8-6f64800f37e9)\n\n![Screenshot 2025-03-07 at 16.42.10.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/25ee9303-88e3-45c0-b38f-e5e5825f8945/b2f1fae0-5ca8-4fe7-963b-b72eb260560d)\n\n[https://www.figma.com/design/74Zz1grTtdFlkydLSZe3q7?node-id=7923-27653#1163774107](https://www.figma.com/design/74Zz1grTtdFlkydLSZe3q7?node-id=7923-27653#1163774107)\n\n## 3\\. Implement Contextual Transaction Descriptions\n\n**Description:**\nUpdate the transaction descriptions to ensure clarity based on the type of transaction. The descriptions should follow this structure:\n\n* **Purchase** \u2192 \"Created allocation of X%\"\n* **Increase** \u2192 \"Increased position by X%\"\n* **Decrease** \u2192 \"Decreased position by X%\"\n* **Sold** \u2192 \"Liquidated full position\"\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n* Ensure the correct verb ('Increased' or 'Decreased') is applied based on the transaction type.\n* Implement logic to map each transaction type to its respective description.\n* Validate that the output makes sense within the transaction context.\n* Test with different transaction types to confirm correct behavior.\n\n[index holding - proper context - TMAI_task (Figma)](https://www.figma.com/design/74Zz1grTtdFlkydLSZe3q7/TMAI_task?node-id=10459-32612&t=TCIC3BAQHQvtHRy6-4)\n\n## 4\\. Treemap View Layout Broken - Elements Overlapping\n\n**Description:**\nThe **Treemap View** is not rendering correctly, as all the elements appear to be **overlapping or nested** inside each other.[https://jam.dev/c/b3c3bcfb-ce28-4b5f-9c5b-08b34d1066bb](https://jam.dev/c/b3c3bcfb-ce28-4b5f-9c5b-08b34d1066bb)\n\n This results in a broken layout, making the data visualization unclear and difficult to interact with.\n\n## 5\\. Sorting Not Persisting Across Pages in Ratings Table\n\n**Description:**\nWhen sorting on the **Ratings Page**, the sorting only applies to the **current page**. Once the user navigates to the **second page**, and the order is not applied to the entire data set. The sorting should persist across all pages, ensuring that the entire dataset is sorted, not just the current page.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/076f68b7-581a-451f-9a52-50c6ee7ee97e](https://jam.dev/c/076f68b7-581a-451f-9a52-50c6ee7ee97e)\n\n## 6\\. Pagination in Inspired Index Holdings Table Redirects to Treemap View\n\n**Description:**\nWhen clicking on the **pagination** controls in the **Inspired Index Holdings** table, the user is unexpectedly redirected to the **Treemap View** instead of navigating through the pages of the table. This issue disrupts the expected user flow and prevents users from properly interacting with the pagination functionality.\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/e2741104-7bd1-45ff-b03a-5a28a6a8ced0](https://jam.dev/c/e2741104-7bd1-45ff-b03a-5a28a6a8ced0)\n\n## 7\\. \"Back\" Button Not Working After Clicking on \"Index Holding\" or \"Index Transaction\" Tabs\n\n**Description:**\nWhen navigating to the **Index Holding** or **Index Transaction** tabs, clicking the **back button**  does not work as expected.

Sign into platform.openai.com, ensure you have API credits, and get an API key if integrating with Cursor.\n2. **Define Your Project**:\n   * Open a chat with o1 and provide a clear prompt. Include your goals, existing codebase context, and design system details. For example:\n\n     ```\n     I\u2019m building a new \"UserSettingsModal\" for a React app with an existing design system (DSButton, DSTypography, etc.) using Tailwind CSS and TypeScript. The modal should allow users to update their username and toggle dark mode. Generate a detailed specification document with:\n     - Component breakdown\n     - Props and state requirements\n     - Step-by-step implementation plan\n     - Integration points with my design system\n     ```\n3. **Refine the Output**:\n   * O1 will produce a structured spec, like:\n\n     ```\n     ### UserSettingsModal Specification\n     \n     #### Component Breakdown\n     - UserSettingsModal (parent component)\n     - DSButton (for Save/Cancel actions)\n     - DSTypography (for labels)\n     - DSInput (for username field)\n     - DSToggle (for dark mode switch)\n     \n     #### Props\n     - `isOpen: boolean` - Controls modal visibility\n     - `onClose: () => void` - Closes the modal\n     - `initialUsername: string` - Pre-filled username\n     - `onSave: (username: string, darkMode: boolean) => void` - Saves changes\n     \n     #### State\n     - `username: string` - Tracks input value\n     - `darkMode: boolean` - Tracks toggle state\n     \n     #### Implementation Steps\n     1. Create `UserSettingsModal.tsx` with a modal wrapper using Tailwind classes (e.g., `fixed inset-0`).\n     2. Add form elements using DSInput and DSToggle from the design system.\n     3. Implement state with `useState` for username and darkMode.\n     4. Use DSButton for Save/Cancel, wiring Save to `onSave`.\n     5. Integrate with existing theme context for dark mode.\n     \n     #### Integration Points\n     - Reuse `DS` components from `src/components/design-system`.\n     - Pull Tailwind utilities from `tailwind.config.js`.\n     ```\n   * Ask follow-ups like, \u201cAdd error handling for empty usernames,\u201d to refine the spec further.\n4. **Export the Spec**:\n   * Copy the markdown or text output to a file (e.g., user-settings-modal-spec.md) in your project folder for reference.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Set Up Cursor with Claude**\n\nCursor AI integrates Claude models (like 3.5 Sonnet) for code generation. Here\u2019s how to use it with your spec.\n\n1. **Configure Claude in Cursor**:\n   * Open Cursor, go to Settings > AI Models, and select Claude 3.5 Sonnet (or input an Anthropic API key if using a custom setup).\n   * Ensure your codebase is indexed (Settings > Codebase Indexing) so Claude understands your design system and structure.\n2. **Import the Spec**:\n   * Open a new file in Cursor (e.g., UserSettingsModal.tsx) and paste the spec into the Chat panel (Cmd + L) or a markdown file in your project. Reference it with @user-settings-modal-spec.md in the chat.\n3. **Prompt Claude to Implement**:\n   * In Cursor\u2019s Chat or Composer (Cmd + I), provide a prompt based on the spec:\n\n     ```\n     Using the spec in @user-settings-modal-spec.md, implement the UserSettingsModal component in TypeScript with React. Use our design system components (DSButton, DSTypography, etc.) from src/components/design-system and Tailwind classes. Ensure it integrates with our existing theme context for dark mode.\n     ```\n   * Claude will generate the code, leveraging your design system. Example output:\n\n     tsx\n\n     ```\n     import React, { useState } from 'react';\n     import { DSButton, DSTypography, DSInput, DSToggle } from '../design-system';\n     import { useTheme } from '../../context/ThemeContext';\n     \n     interface UserSettingsModalProps {\n       isOpen: boolean;\n       onClose: () => void;\n       initialUsername: string;\n       onSave: (username: string, darkMode: boolean) => void;\n     }\n     \n     export const UserSettingsModal: React.FC<UserSettingsModalProps> = ({\n       isOpen,\n       onClose,\n       initialUsername,\n       onSave,\n     }) => {\n       const { darkMode: themeDarkMode, setDarkMode } = useTheme();\n       const [username, setUsername] = useState(initialUsername);\n       const [darkMode, setLocalDarkMode] = useState(themeDarkMode);\n     \n       if (!isOpen) return null;\n     \n       const handleSave = () => {\n         if (!username.trim()) return alert('Username cannot be empty');\n         onSave(username, darkMode);\n         setDarkMode(darkMode); // Sync with theme context\n         onClose();\n       };\n     \n       return (\n         <div className=\"fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50 flex items-center justify-center\">\n           <div className=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg\">\n             <DSTypography variant=\"h3\">Settings</DSTypography>\n             <DSInput\n               label=\"Username\"\n               value={username}\n               onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)}\n               className=\"mt-4\"\n             />\n             <DSToggle\n               label=\"Dark Mode\"\n               checked={darkMode}\n               onChange={() => setLocalDarkMode(!darkMode)}\n               className=\"mt-4\"\n             />\n             <div className=\"mt-6 flex gap-4\">\n               <DSButton variant=\"primary\" onClick={handleSave}>\n                 Save\n               </DSButton>\n               <DSButton variant=\"secondary\" onClick={onClose}>\n                 Cancel\n               </DSButton>\n             </div>\n           </div>\n         </div>\n       );\n     };\n     ```\n4. **Refine with Cursor\u2019s Tools**:\n   * Use Cmd + K to edit specific parts (e.g., \u201cAdd a loading state to the Save button\u201d).\n   * Debug with Chat (e.g., \u201cWhy isn\u2019t the dark mode toggle updating the theme?\u201d) and apply fixes.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Integrate and Test**\n\n* **Link to Existing Code**: Ensure the new component fits your codebase (e.g., import it into ProfilePage.tsx and pass props from your state management).\n* **Test Locally**: Run npm start in Cursor\u2019s terminal and verify functionality.\n* **Iterate**: Use Claude in Cursor to tweak based on feedback (e.g., \u201cAdd form validation styling from our design system\u201d).\n\n---\n\n**Tips for Success**\n\n* **O1 Strengths**: Use o1 for planning and architecture\u2014it\u2019s slower but excels at breaking down complex tasks. Keep prompts specific and iterative.\n* **Claude in Cursor**: Leverage Claude\u2019s speed and code-writing ability. Provide it with o1\u2019s spec and your .cursorrules file (e.g., \"useExistingComponents\": true) to enforce design system usage.\n* **Context Sharing**: If o1 isn\u2019t in Cursor, manually copy its spec into Cursor\u2019s Chat or a file. Alternatively, explore integrating o1 via OpenAI\u2019s API in Cursor Settings if supported by March 06, 2025.\n\nThis workflow splits the load: o1 handles the thinking, Claude handles the coding, and Cursor ties it into your existing setup\u2014perfect for your Figma-to-code scenario with a design system!",

          "body": "To effectively use Cursor AI to convert Figma designs into code that integrates seamlessly with an existing codebase and design system, you\u2019ll need a structured approach that leverages Cursor\u2019s AI capabilities alongside tools like Builder.io\u2019s Visual Copilot. Below is a step-by-step guide tailored to your goal:\n\n---\n\n**1. Prepare Your Figma Design**\n\n* **Use Auto Layout**: Ensure your Figma designs utilize Auto Layout wherever possible. This helps tools like Visual Copilot interpret spacing, alignment, and responsiveness accurately, aligning with your design system\u2019s structure.\n* **Component Mapping**: If your design system is already reflected in Figma (e.g., reusable buttons, cards, or typography styles), label these components clearly and consistently with your codebase naming conventions. This aids in mapping Figma elements to existing code components.\n* **Organize Layers**: Give meaningful names to layers and frames (e.g., \"PrimaryButton\" or \"HeaderSection\") that mirror your codebase\u2019s structure. This reduces guesswork during code generation.\n\n---\n\n**2. Set Up Cursor AI and Visual Copilot**\n\n* **Install Visual Copilot**: Add the Visual Copilot plugin to Figma (available via Builder.io or the Figma Community). This tool converts Figma designs into frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular, and supports styling libraries (e.g., Tailwind, Styled Components) that might already be in your codebase.\n* **Download Cursor**: Install Cursor, an AI-powered code editor built on VS Code, which will refine and integrate the generated code into your project.\n* **Configure Your Environment**: Open your existing codebase in Cursor. Ensure it has access to your design system\u2019s component library, styles, and dependencies.\n\n---\n\n**3. Generate Initial Code with Visual Copilot**\n\n* **Select Your Design**: In Figma, open the Visual Copilot plugin, select the frame or layer you want to convert, and specify the framework and styling solution used in your codebase (e.g., \"React with Tailwind\").\n* **Provide Context**: Inform Visual Copilot about your project\u2019s context\u2014e.g., \"This is a new dashboard card for our analytics module using our design system\u2019s Card component.\" This helps it reuse existing components where possible.\n* **Export Code**: Click \"Generate Code\" to get a preview. Copy the generated code or command (depending on the workflow) for use in Cursor.\n\n---\n\n**4. Refine and Integrate with Cursor AI**\n\n* **Paste into Cursor**: Open Cursor and paste the generated code into a new or existing file in your project.\n* **Set Up Rules**: Create a .cursorrules file in your project root to enforce coding standards and patterns from your existing codebase. For example:\n\n  ```\n  // .cursorrules\n  {\n    \"useExistingComponents\": true,\n    \"componentPrefix\": \"DS\", // e.g., DSButton for design system components\n    \"styleLibrary\": \"tailwind\",\n    \"typescript\": true\n  }\n  ```\n\n  This ensures Cursor aligns the output with your design system and conventions.\n* **Refactor with AI**: Use Cursor\u2019s \u2318 K (Command + K) feature to refactor the code. For instance, prompt it with: \"Replace hardcoded styles with our design system\u2019s Tailwind classes\" or \"Map this button to our DSButton component.\"\n* **Chat for Adjustments**: Use Cursor\u2019s Chat feature to ask questions like, \"How do I integrate this with our Redux store?\" or \"Add hover states using our design system\u2019s utilities.\" Cursor will suggest precise edits based on your codebase context.\n\n---\n\n**5. Leverage Your Existing Codebase**\n\n* **Component Reuse**: If Visual Copilot didn\u2019t automatically map to your components, manually adjust the generated code in Cursor. For example, replace <button className=\"bg-blue-500\"> with <DSButton variant=\"primary\">.\n* **Context Awareness**: Cursor\u2019s strength is its understanding of your entire codebase. Highlight the generated code and use the Composer feature (e.g., \u2318 + Shift + I) to make architectural changes, like wiring it into your state management system or routing logic.\n* **Consistency Check**: Run Cursor\u2019s bug finder or semantic search to ensure the new code adheres to your codebase\u2019s patterns and doesn\u2019t introduce inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**6. Optimize for Responsiveness**\n\n* Visual Copilot generates responsive layouts, but your design system might have specific breakpoints or utilities. In Cursor, tweak the code with prompts like: \"Ensure this layout matches our 12-column grid system at all breakpoints\" or \"Use our media query helpers from the design system.\"\n\n---\n\n**7. Test and Iterate**\n\n* **Preview Locally**: Run your project locally to test the new component or page. Cursor\u2019s terminal integration lets you execute commands (e.g., npm start) without leaving the editor.\n* **Iterate with AI**: If the design drifts from the Figma spec, use Cursor\u2019s Chat to debug\u2014e.g., \"Why is this padding off by 4px compared to the design?\"\u2014and apply fixes instantly.\n* **Collaborate**: Share the updated branch with your team via GitHub. Cursor can even generate AI-assisted commit messages reflecting your design system updates.\n\n---\n\n**Tips for Success**\n\n* **Train the AI**: If your design system has unique patterns (e.g., custom hooks or naming conventions), include examples in .builderrules (for Visual Copilot) or .cursorrules (for Cursor) to improve output accuracy.\n* **Start Small**: Test the workflow with a single component (e.g., a button or card) before scaling to full pages.\n* **Sync Design Tokens**: If your design system uses tokens (e.g., colors, spacing), ensure they\u2019re defined in Figma and mirrored in your codebase\u2019s CSS variables or theme files for consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Example Workflow**\n\n1. In Figma: Design a \"UserProfileCard\" using your design system\u2019s components.\n2. In Visual Copilot: Generate React + Tailwind code, specifying \"Use our DSButton and DSTypography components.\"\n3. In Cursor: Paste the code, refactor with \u2318 K to replace generic styles with your design system\u2019s utilities, and integrate it into your ProfilePage module.\n4. Test and commit: Verify it renders correctly and push it to your repo.\n\n---\n\nBy combining Visual Copilot\u2019s Figma-to-code generation with Cursor\u2019s AI-driven refinement, you can transform designs into production-ready code that respects your existing codebase and design system. This workflow minimizes manual effort, ensures consistency, and accelerates development\u2014all while leveraging the tools\u2019 understanding of your project\u2019s unique context.",

Removing it will simplify our product offerings, reduce maintenance efforts, and allow us to allocate resources toward higher-tier plans that better meet customer needs and drive increased revenue.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. The BASIC plan is successfully removed from the Stripe dashboard.\n2. Users cannot subscribe to the BASIC plan through the application.\n3. Existing BASIC subscribers receive notifications and are transitioned to an alternative plan without service interruption.\n4. All references to the BASIC plan are deleted from the application interface and related documentation.\n5. Comprehensive testing confirms that the removal does not impact other subscription plans or system functionalities.\n\n---",

For example, Ponke is available on both DEXes and CEXes, but with Bitquery, we only get data from Solana, whereas Coingecko aggregates total volume across all CEXes and DEXes. Another example is Turbo, which originates from Ethereum and is bridged to Solana. Bitquery treats its addresses on different chains as separate tokens, while Coingecko consolidates them into one.\n\nIn general, there aren\u2019t too many of these tokens, and most are likely available on Coingecko, which is why I recommend prioritizing it. However, Bitquery is useful for tokens that aren\u2019t listed on Coingecko\u2014typically smaller-cap, single-chain tokens that aren\u2019t traded on CEXes.\n\nThat said, we have a pipeline that merges data from both Bitquery and Coingecko.

      "description": "@ian said:\n\n> Dev containers, short for development containers, are a way to create consistent, isolated, and reproducible development environments using containerization technology (like Docker). They allow developers to package an application\u2019s code, dependencies, tools, and configurations into a single, portable unit that can run reliably across different machines or platforms.\n>\n> ### Key Purpose of Dev Containers\n>\n> 1. ***Consistency***: Ensure that every developer working on a project uses the same setup (e.g., same versions of programming languages, libraries, and tools), eliminating \"it works on my machine\" issues.\n> 2. ***Isolation***: Keep the development environment separate from the host system, avoiding conflicts between tools or dependencies used for different projects.\n> 3. ***Portability***: Easily share the environment with teammates or move it between machines (e.g., local dev laptop, CI/CD pipeline, or cloud).\n> 4. ***Simplified Setup***: Reduce the time spent configuring a development environment by defining it in code (usually via a `devcontainer.json` file).\n>\n> ### How They Work\n>\n> Dev containers are typically used with tools like ***Visual Studio Code***\\* (via the Remote - Containers extension) or other IDEs that support the \\****Dev Container specification***. Here\u2019s the basic idea:\n> \u2022 A configuration file (e.g., `devcontainer.json`) defines the container\u2019s setup, including:\n>     \u25e6 The base container image (e.g., `node:18`, `python:3.9`).\n>     \u25e6 Installed extensions, tools, or runtime...",

Improved monitoring through Axelar ensures better oversight of bridge operations, enabling timely issue resolution and maintaining user trust.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. **Fallback RPC Endpoints:**\n   * Integrate at least three additional RPC endpoints as fallbacks.\n   * Ensure automatic failover to fallback endpoints upon primary endpoint failure.\n2. **Transaction Monitoring:**\n   * Implement Axelar for real-time monitoring of all bridge transactions.\n   * Set up alerts for failed or suspicious transactions.\n3. **Testing:**\n   * Demonstrate reduced transaction failures on testnets through comprehensive testing.\n   * Validate the functionality of fallback mechanisms and monitoring tools.\n4. **Documentation:**\n   * Provide updated documentation detailing the new RPC endpoints and monitoring setup.\n5. **Deployment:**\n   * Successfully deploy enhancements to the staging environment with no critical issues.",

Additionally, the team raised a concern about whether a 12-hour sync frequency might be too infrequent, which should be reviewed during implementation.",

Each function requiring data retrieves it from this common function.\n\n#### **Issues:**\n\n* For pages without pagination, a large amount of subscribed data leads to resource wastage.\n* Memory caching in RAM is fine for small amounts of data, but it impacts user performance when scaling.\n* Overlapping logic: The common function currently handles both reading and request logic, making it complex and difficult to maintain.\n\n#### **New Architecture:**\n\n* Replace memory cache with **IndexedDB** to store larger data volumes (client side).\n* Decouple logic: When subscribing a token to the socket, the function will call the token with an ID. Upon receiving a response, it will update the database. The function will not return data directly\u2014components that need data will retrieve it from the database.\n* Unified data sharing: All socket-related price data will be stored in a dedicated database. **Token details** and the **rating page** will fetch data from the same source, preventing mismatched data issues.\n\n![Socket_structure.drawio.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/29c34c33-bc80-4773-ad31-cab1ab6ae1d0/ebeab78f-d558-496d-a49f-50c24eb72c1f)\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/13royyN3OPRKb-gi92t00Zo4jS7X9sBYy/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13royyN3OPRKb-gi92t00Zo4jS7X9sBYy/view?usp=sharing)\n\nCode example:\n\n```typescript\n// Subscribe data\nexport const useSubscribeTokenPrice = (filteredData: RatingDataResponse[]) => {\n  const { getTokenPrice } = useTokenPriceV2();\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const subscribeToTokenPriceChange = (tokens: Array<RatingDataResponse>) => {\n      const tokenIds = tokens.map((token) => token.CG_ID);\n      getTokenPrice(tokenIds);\n    };\n\n    subscribeToTokenPriceChange(filteredData);\n  }, [filteredData, getTokenPrice]);\n};\n```\n\n```typescript\nexport async function getTokenSocketPrice(cgid: string): Promise<Token> {\n  const db = await initDB();\n  const tx = db.transaction(IDB_STORE.SOCKET.TOKEN_PRICE, \"readonly\");\n  const store = tx.objectStore(IDB_STORE.SOCKET.TOKEN_PRICE);\n  return store.get(cgid) || {};\n}\n\n\nexport const AutoPriceChangeDynamic = ({\n  id,\n  renderPriceChange,\n  onChange,\n}: {\n  id: string;\n  renderPriceChange: (tokenPrice: Token | undefined) => React.ReactNode;\n  onChange: (data: Token | undefined) => void;\n}) => {\n  const { data } = useQuery({\n    queryKey: [\"token-socket-price\", id],\n    queryFn: () => getTokenSocketPrice(id),\n    refetchInterval: 3000,\n  });\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (data?.cgid === id) {\n      onChange(data);\n    }\n  }, [data, id]);\n\n  return renderPriceChange(data);\n};\n```\n\ndemo:\n\n[https://jam.dev/c/f221b77b-814c-4df9-9ff5-6dde5da209dc](https://jam.dev/c/f221b77b-814c-4df9-9ff5-6dde5da209dc)\ncc @ian @suleman ",

This integration will enable real-time updates, ensuring that users view the most current token information without manual refreshes.\n\n**Business Rationale:**\nOffering real-time token data enhances user experience by providing timely and accurate information, which is critical for users making informed decisions. This improvement supports our goal of delivering reliable and up-to-date metrics, thereby increasing user engagement and satisfaction.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. The new websocket is successfully connected to the Ratings page and replaces the existing data source.\n2. Token data on the Ratings page updates in real time as data is received from the websocket.\n3. The Ratings page maintains performance standards with no noticeable latency or disruptions during data updates.\n4. Proper error handling is implemented for websocket connection failures, including user notifications if live updates are unavailable.\n5. All relevant documentation is updated, and unit/integration tests cover the new websocket functionality.",

      "description": "[Trading agent revamp (Ben) - TMAI_task (Figma)](https://www.figma.com/design/74Zz1grTtdFlkydLSZe3q7/TMAI_task?node-id=8778-73005&t=dIa8WtnucWEdvUVN-4)\n\nGroomed Issue:\n\n**Title:** Front End Implementation of Trading Agent V2 - Agent Listing Page (List View)\n\n**Description:**\nDevelop the front-end for the Trading Agent V2's Agent Listing Page in List View, based on the Figma design [here](https://www.figma.com/design/74Zz1grTtdFlkydLSZe3q7/TMAI_task?node-id=8778-73005&t=dIa8WtnucWEdvUVN-4). This page will display all V1 Trading AI Agents integrated with Privy and Fiat gateways, allowing users to view and manage their trading agents efficiently.\n\n**Business Rationale:**\nEnhancing the Agent Listing Page with the V2 design will improve user experience by providing a more intuitive and streamlined interface. Integrating Privy and Fiat gateways supports broader payment options, catering to a wider user base and increasing platform usability and adoption.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. **Design Implementation:** The Agent Listing Page matches the provided Figma design in layout, styling, and responsiveness across major browsers and devices.\n2. **Agent Display:** All V1 Trading AI Agents with Privy and Fiat gateways are listed with accurate details, including agent name, status, and gateway type.\n3. **Interactivity:** Users can perform essential actions such as viewing agent details, editing settings, and deleting agents directly from the list view.\n4. **Performance:** The page loads within acceptable timeframes and handles data efficiently without lag.\n5. **Accessibility:** The page adheres to accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1), ensuring it is usable by all users.\n6. **Testing:** Comprehensive front-end tests are written and pass, covering key functionalities and UI components.",

          "body": "**Report on Privy Integration for Balance and Token List Retrieval**\n\nDuring the implementation of the Privy endpoints for retrieving user balances and token lists, I discovered that Privy does not still support this functionality. Their documentation no longer includes a wallet balance page.\n\nTo find an alternative approach, I attempted to use Viem to fetch wallet balances. However, I encountered an issue where Viem was only returning the balance of ETH and ignoring other tokens. I then tried retrieving the balances of other tokens by passing their respective contract addresses and decimals, but I consistently received an error stating that the contract *\"does not implement balanceOf.\"*\n\nGiven these challenges, I reached out to Chao, and it was confirmed that the data team already has existing endpoints for retrieving wallet balances and token lists. These endpoints allow fetching wallet balances using a wallet address and chain ID, as well as retrieving a comprehensive token list. The relevant API documentation is as follows:\n\n* **Token List:** [Token List API](https://tm-tradingbot-api.data-service.tokenmetrics.com/docs#/default/get_all_tokens_info_get_all_tokens_info_get)\n* **Wallet Balance:** [Wallet Balance API](https://tm-tradingbot-api.data-service.tokenmetrics.com/docs#/default/get_wallet_balance_get_wallet_balance_post)\n\nBased on this, the recommended approach is to use these existing data service endpoints instead of Privy or Viem, ensuring accurate and reliable balance and token retrieval.\n\n```\n/api/privy/get-wallet-balance?address=0xBFd723bA591931a260D2859fA0c6611823779dfE\n```",

Documentation\n   * Update internal docs with integration details, USDC focus, and custom fee implementation\n\n## Resources:\n\n* Privy Fiat On-Ramp Demo: [https://github.com/privy-io/fiat-onramp-demo](https://github.com/privy-io/fiat-onramp-demo)\n* Coinbase Onramp SDK Docs: [https://help.coinbase.com/en/developer-platform/coinbase-onramp-sdk](https://help.coinbase.com/en/developer-platform/coinbase-onramp-sdk)\n* Privy Docs on Funding Wallets: [https://docs.privy.io/guide/react/wallets/usage/funding/](https://docs.privy.io/guide/react/wallets/usage/funding/)\n* Coinbase Onramp API Overview: [https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/onramp/docs/api-overview](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/onramp/docs/api-overview)\n* Coinbase Custom Fees Documentation: [https://docs.cloud.coinbase.com/exchange/docs/fees](https://docs.cloud.coinbase.com/exchange/docs/fees)\n\n## Notes:\n\n* Emphasize USDC as the primary purchase option due to zero fees on Coinbase Onramp\n* Custom fee implementation:\n  1. Coinbase allows partners to add their own fees on top of transactions.\n  2. Custom fees can be implemented by adjusting the purchase amount or through a separate transaction.\n  3. Clearly disclose any additional fees to users in the UI.\n  4. Consider implementing a tiered fee structure based on transaction volume.\n  5. Ensure compliance with local regulations regarding fee disclosure and cryptocurrency purchases.\n* Coinbase Onramp supports 100+ cryptocurrencies and 60+ fiat currencies, but focus on USDC for fee-free transactions\n* Implement error handling and user feedback mechanisms for both standard and custom fee scenarios\n* Consider offering educational content about the benefits of USDC purchases through the platform",

      "description": "### **Background**\n\nThe current payment confirmation method involves users sending requests from the frontend after completing their payment. This approach has proven to be unreliable, as evidenced by a recent issue where a user did not receive Premium access despite their payment being confirmed.\n\nThe lead engineer suspects multiple potential causes, including network issues on the user's side, temporary downtime on the platform, or limitations in the current manual request approach. Additionally, the team acknowledges that moving to a webhook-based system would provide a more robust solution.\n\nSlack Chat here: [https://token-metrics-group.slack.com/archives/C07TQH2UCAV/p1735561157456169](https://token-metrics-group.slack.com/archives/C07TQH2UCAV/p1735561157456169)\n\n---\n\n### **Investigation**\n\n1. **Review Logs**\n   * Examine server logs and payment logs for the specific user on the mentioned date to identify the root cause of the issue.\n   * Look for any network errors, timeout issues, or platform downtimes that might have affected the payment confirmation process.\n2. **Analyze the Current Workflow**\n   * Map out the end-to-end flow of the current payment confirmation process.\n   * Identify weaknesses or bottlenecks, especially in scenarios involving user-side network issues or server downtime.\n3. **Feasibility of Webhook Implementation**\n   * Investigate why a webhook-based approach was deemed \"not possible\" during the initial implementation.\n   * Review current contracts or systems to determine if webhook endpoints can now be integrated.\n4. **Benchmarking**\n   * Research and document industry standards for payment confirmation, particularly how leading platforms handle this process.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementation**\n\n1. **Develop Webhook-Based Confirmation**\n   * Design and implement a webhook system where payment confirmation is handled server-side.\n   * Ensure that payment gateways or smart contracts trigger the webhook to send payment status directly to the backend.\n2. **Test for Reliability**\n   * Conduct thorough testing to simulate various user scenarios, including network instability and system downtime.\n   * Implement redundancy measures to handle webhook retries in case of failures.\n3. **Graceful Transition**\n   * Implement the new system in parallel with the existing method initially.\n   * Migrate users to the new system after ensuring stability.\n4. **Documentation and Monitoring**\n   * Document the new process in detail for future reference.\n   * Set up real-time monitoring and alerting systems to track payment confirmation and quickly identify anomalies.\n\n---\n\n### **Outcome**\n\nThis task will result in a more reliable and automated payment confirmation system, significantly reducing the likelihood of users not receiving their premium access due to technical issues.",

      "description": "**Objective:**\nRefactor the application code (Next.js) to query OLTP data via Prisma (Supabase) instead of Snowflake. Keep Snowflake queries for OLAP tasks only.\n\n**Description:**\n\n* Find and replace Snowflake OLTP queries with Prisma queries against Supabase.\n* Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data.\n* (Optional) Consider edge deployments (e.g., Vercel) for lower latency globally.\n\n**Execution Steps (with Cursor AI):**\n\n1. Have Cursor AI:\n   * Provide code snippets to replace Snowflake queries with Prisma queries.\n   * Suggest caching logic using Redis.\n   * Propose edge configuration if needed.\n2. If Cursor AI fails:\n   * Manually refactor queries and add caching logic.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n* All OLTP queries now use Prisma (Supabase).\n* Redis caching reduces load times for hot endpoints.\n* Application runs without OLTP dependency on Snowflake.\n\nInitial steps: (cc @ian @suleman @jake)\n[https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/relational-databases-typescript-postgresql](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/relational-databases-typescript-postgresql)\n\n* `npm install prisma --save-dev`\n* `npx prisma init`\n* Update .env add DATABASE_URL (@jake will give the URL)\n* `npx prisma db pull`\n* `npm install @prisma/client `\n  * `touch src/lib/prisma.ts`\n  * [https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/blob/latest/orm/nextjs-api-routes/src/lib/prisma.ts](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/blob/latest/orm/nextjs-api-routes/src/lib/prisma.ts)",

      "description": "**High-Level Objective:**\nMigrate our OLTP workloads from Snowflake to Supabase Postgres using Prisma ORM, while keeping Snowflake dedicated to OLAP. By separating transactional and analytical queries, we aim to reduce latency, improve scalability, enhance developer velocity, and set the stage for future architectural improvements. This serves as an intermediary step before considering potential long-term migrations to ClickHouse or StarRocks.\n\n**Context & Business Value:**\nToken Metrics currently relies on Snowflake for both OLTP and OLAP, causing latency and performance bottlenecks for user-facing queries. Moving OLTP to Supabase Postgres and integrating Prisma will deliver faster response times for critical, real-time data queries. Users benefit from quicker insights, improving their trading decisions and overall satisfaction. Faster queries also differentiate Token Metrics from competitors and reduce costs over time.\n\n**Key Points & Clarifications:**\n\n* We already have a Supabase account and can create or use a dedicated project/database for OLTP workloads.\n* Prisma needs a target database to manage the schema, so we will set up Prisma with Supabase first, then migrate data from Snowflake into the newly prepared schema.\n* Cursor AI should be used as a first resort for each step. If Cursor AI can\u2019t complete a task, give it feedback and try again. Only if it still fails should we proceed manually.\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n* Cursor AI first approach at every step.\n* Redis caching, PgBouncer, and edge deployments are optional optimizations depending on complexity and time.\n* This interim state improves performance before any potential future migration to ClickHouse or StarRocks.\n\n**Success Criteria for Overall Project:**\n\n* OLTP fully migrated and served by Supabase + Prisma.\n* Snowflake reserved for OLAP without latency impacting user-facing queries.\n* Verified performance improvements (reduced latency, stable load performance).\n* Clear path established for scaling to 10+ million users.",

      "description": "## 1\\. Optimize API routes\n\n1. List all current API routes and their sizes.\n2. Group API routes by functionality.\n3. For each group:\n\n   a. Identify common functionalities that can be combined.\n\n   b. Refactor to create a single API route handling multiple related operations.\n4. Implement API route segmentation for larger handlers.\n5. Convert suitable API routes to Edge API Routes:\n\n   a. Identify routes that don't require Node.js-specific features or npm packages incompatible with Edge Runtime.\n\n   b. Refactor these routes to use Edge Runtime:\n   * Move the file to `/pages/api` directory if not already there.\n   * Export a default function with the `config` object specifying Edge Runtime:\n\n     ```javascript\n     export const config = {\n       runtime: 'edge',\n     };\n     ```\n   * Ensure the route only uses Web APIs available in Edge Runtime.\n   * Update any database queries or external service calls to be compatible with Edge Runtime.\n\n   c. Test thoroughly to ensure functionality is maintained.\n\n   d. Measure latency improvements, especially for geographically distant users.\n6. Implement proper error handling and rate limiting for all API routes.\n7. Measure and document the size reduction and performance improvement for each optimized route.\n\n## 2\\. Review and optimize middleware\n\n1. Analyze the current middleware implementation.\n2. List all functionalities handled by the middleware.\n3. Identify any redundant or unnecessary checks.\n4. Split middleware into smaller, focused functions.\n5. Implement conditional middleware execution based on the route.\n6. Use efficient data structures (e.g., Set instead of Array for lookups).\n7. Consider moving appropriate middleware to Edge Middleware for improved performance:\n\n   a. Identify middleware that doesn't require Node.js-specific features.\n\n   b. Refactor to use Edge Runtime compatible code.\n\n   c. Test thoroughly to ensure functionality is maintained.\n8. Measure the middleware size and execution time before and after optimization.\n\n## 3\\. Review and optimize data fetching\n\n1. Audit all data fetching methods in the application.\n2. For client-side data fetching:\n\n   a. Implement SWR or React Query for all suitable data fetches.\n\n   b. Set up proper caching strategies for each fetch.\n\n   c. Implement error boundaries for fetch failures.\n\n   d. Use optimistic updates where appropriate to improve perceived performance.\n3. For server-side data fetching:\n\n   a. Review all uses of getServerSideProps and getStaticProps.\n\n   b. Implement Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) where appropriate:\n   * Identify pages with data that changes infrequently.\n   * Set up revalidation periods tailored to each page's data freshness requirements.\n\n   c. Use getStaticProps with fallback for dynamic pages where possible:\n   * Implement for pages with a large number of dynamic routes.\n   * Ensure proper loading states for fallback pages.\n4. Implement data prefetching for critical resources:\n\n   a. Use `next/link` with `prefetch` prop for important page navigations.\n\n   b. Implement custom prefetching for crucial API data.\n5. Leverage Next.js 13 app directory and React Server Components where beneficial:\n\n   a. Identify components that can be converted to Server Components.\n\n   b. Refactor data fetching to occur on the server where possible.\n\n   c. Implement streaming for improved loading performance.\n6. Optimize database queries:\n\n   a. Review and optimize complex queries.\n\n   b. Implement appropriate indexing.\n\n   c. Consider using database-specific optimization techniques (e.g., PostgreSQL materialized views).\n7. Implement efficient caching strategies:\n\n   a. Set up Redis or a similar in-memory cache for frequently accessed data.\n\n   b. Implement cache invalidation mechanisms to ensure data freshness.\n8. Measure and document improvements in load times, data freshness, and overall application responsiveness.\n\n## 4\\. API Response Optimization\n\n1. Implement JSON response compression:\n\n   a. Use gzip or Brotli compression for API responses.\n\n   b. Ensure Cloudflare is configured to respect and maintain compression.\n2. Optimize response payload:\n\n   a. Audit API responses to ensure only necessary data is being sent.\n\n   b. Implement GraphQL for flexible data querying if appropriate.\n3. Implement response caching where possible:\n\n   a. Use Cache-Control headers effectively.\n\n   b. Leverage Cloudflare's caching capabilities for static or infrequently changing responses.\n\n## 5\\. Error Handling and Monitoring\n\n1. Implement comprehensive error handling across all API routes and middleware.\n2. Set up detailed logging for backend operations:\n\n   a. Use a structured logging format for easy parsing and analysis.\n\n   b. Ensure sensitive information is not logged.\n3. Integrate with existing Sentry setup for error tracking and performance monitoring:\n\n   a. Set up custom performance traces for critical backend operations.\n\n   b. Configure alerts for unusual error rates or performance degradations.\n\n## 6\\. Security Enhancements\n\n1. Implement or review API rate limiting to prevent abuse.\n2. Ensure all endpoints are properly authenticated and authorized.\n3. Implement CORS policies appropriately for different environments.\n4. Review and update input validation and sanitization across all API routes.\n\n## 7\\. Documentation\n\n1. Update API documentation to reflect any changes made during optimization.\n2. Document new patterns or best practices established during the optimization process.\n3. Create or update runbooks for common backend operations and troubleshooting.\n\nThroughout the optimization process, maintain close communication with the frontend team to ensure that backend changes are compatible with frontend requirements and to coordinate any necessary frontend updates.",

      "description": "Token Metrics is experiencing performance issues, as indicated by recent PageSpeed Insights reports. \n\nKey performance metrics such as Time to First Byte (TTFB), First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), and Total Blocking Time (TBT) are below optimal thresholds. This issue aims to address these bottlenecks by outlining actionable tasks for the development team.\n\nCurrent Performance Metrics:\n\n```\n\u2022\tTime to First Byte (TTFB): 1.5s (Goal: < 600ms)\n\n\u2022\tFirst Contentful Paint (FCP): 9.3s (Goal: < 2.5s)\n\n\u2022\tLargest Contentful Paint (LCP): 9.6s (Goal: < 2.5s)\n\n\u2022\tTotal Blocking Time (TBT): 1,470ms (Goal: < 300ms)\n```\n\nStart first optimizing the highest opportunity pages according to Sentry below.\n\n[https://tokenmetrics-30.sentry.io/performance/?environment=production&statsPeriod=90d](https://tokenmetrics-30.sentry.io/performance/?environment=production&statsPeriod=90d)\n\n![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/3973b0e9-3f84-4e56-bc80-5f55fe46609b/06c792c0-a832-4358-9499-01fc15814ad0/7d9f0df5-07a8-440a-bb60-a7a560ebd961)\n\nAcceptance Criteria\n\n```\n\u2022\tPerformance Goals Met:\n\n\u2022\tTTFB is under 600ms.\n\n\u2022\tFCP and LCP are under 2.5s.\n\n\u2022\tTBT is under 300ms.\n\n\u2022\tFunctionality Unaffected:\n\n\u2022\tAll existing features work as before.\n\n\u2022\tNo new bugs or regressions introduced.\n\n\u2022\tCode Quality Maintained:\n\n\u2022\tAll changes are reviewed and approved.\n\n\u2022\tCode adheres to existing style guidelines.\n\n\u2022\tTesting Completed:\n\n\u2022\tAll unit and integration tests pass.\n\n\u2022\tNew tests added for any new functionality.\n\n\u2022\tMonitoring in Place:\n\n\u2022\tPerformance monitoring tools are active.\n\n\u2022\tAlerts configured for performance regressions.\n```\n\n## 1\\. Optimize large pages\n\n1. Use the Next.js bundle analyzer to identify the largest components in `/[locale]/trading-bot/highest-rated`, `/[locale]/settings`, and `/[locale]/old/[...token]`.\n2. For each identified large component:\n\n   a. Implement dynamic imports using `next/dynamic`.\n\n   b. Add loading states or skeletons for dynamically imported components.\n3. Use the `priority` prop on `next/image` for above-the-fold images.\n4. Implement virtualization for long lists using `react-window` or `react-virtualized`.\n5. Run the bundle analyzer again and compare sizes. Aim for at least a 20% reduction.\n\n## 2\\. Reduce shared bundle size\n\n1. Run `npm ls` to list all dependencies and their sizes.\n2. Identify large or redundant packages.\n3. Use a tool like `depcheck` to find unused dependencies.\n4. Remove or replace large packages with lighter alternatives where possible.\n5. Audit import statements across the project, replacing default imports with named imports where applicable.\n6. Implement code splitting for large third-party libraries using dynamic imports.\n7. Compare the new shared bundle size with the original. Target a 15-25% reduction.\n\n## 3\\. Analyze and optimize third-party libraries\n\n1. Review the usage of '@stablelib/random' and identify why it's causing import issues.\n2. If '@stablelib/random' is necessary, fix the import by using named imports instead of default import.\n3. If it's not critical, find a lighter alternative or implement the functionality natively.\n4. Use the `import cost` VS Code extension to identify other large imports.\n5. For each large third-party library:\n\n   a. Evaluate if it's necessary or if it can be replaced with a lighter alternative.\n\n   b. If kept, ensure only necessary parts are imported.\n\n   c. Consider lazy loading the library if it's not needed immediately.\n6. Document changes made and their impact on bundle size.",
